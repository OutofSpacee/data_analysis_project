What definitions of fascism have been useful to scholars of historical and present-day political movements? What understandings of the body, the human, and the state do the analysis of 'fascism' allow or obscure?

Does it have a single meaning or any meaning(s) at all? What kind of meaning is even at issue when we inquire into life's meaning? Is a meaningful life a good life? Are things like pleasure, knowledge, beauty, or achievements ingredients of a good life? Why if so? If life can be meaningful, then it seems like it makes sense to want it to never end- it makes sense to want to be immortal. But does it? Could an immortal life be a meaning ful life? If not, then that seems to suggest that death isn't so bad. But death also seemsquite bad! What is it about death that makes it bad? Is it possible to make sense of death in a philosophically rigorous way? These are some of the many questions that will be explored in this course, using texts and tools from the intellectual tradition of contemporary analytic Western philosophy.",202408,Philosophy,Undergrad,1,Nicholas Laskowski,30,1,29,1,2024-08-01

Nonnaturalists claim that morality cannot be located in the natural world - it's its own separate kind of thing entirely. Henry Sidgwick's The Method of Ethics and G. E. Moore's Principia Ethica set the agenda for the debate at the turn of the 20th century. David Copp's Ethical Naturalism and the Problem of Normativity and John Bengson's, Terence Cuneo's, and Russ Shafer-Landau's The Moral Universe are two forthcoming books that are well placed to have a similar influence in the 21st century.

To contextualize these experiences, we study the legal basis of Roman slavery, epigraphic self-representations, and stereotyping representations of freedpersons by free authors. We also read our authors against comparable works by freeborn analogues--the senator Cicero, the poet Horace, and the philosopher Seneca--to test the boundaries of how the identity of libertus (""freedman"") affected and failed to affect our authors' literary aims. To deepen our study of how historical conditions shape the creation of freed authorship and the transmission of freed authors, we also read, and consider the conditions surrounding the publication of, American freedpersons' literature.",202408,Classics,Undergrad,1,Peter Osorio,35,2,33,0,2024-08-01

This seminar asks whether and how 'fascism' and 'anti-fascism' might be useful terms for social, historical, and political analysis. From the association of fascism with police violence and colonial domination to the characterization of contemporary anti-immigrant discourses as fascistic, there have been a variety of late twentieth and early twenty-first century invocations of fascism as a rising aspect of political mobilization around the world. What definitions of fascism have been useful to scholars of historical and present-day political movements? What understandings of the body, the human, and the state do the analysis of 'fascism' allow or obscure? How have different anti-fascist mobilizations intersected with (or failed to intersect with) other related social movements?",202408,"Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies",Grad,1,Neel Ahuja,14,0,14,0,2024-08-01

FMSC270,"Sex, Drugs, and Social Media: Adolescent Health and Development","This course will ask: How can families, schools, communities, and society help adolescents to navigate contemporary stressors and develop into physically and mentally healthy adults? To do this, we will use research, and an understanding of adolescent development, to explore and analyze issues affecting the health and behavior of American adolescents. Such issues include (but are not limited to) sex education, the role of social media in mental health, substance use, policing in schools, dating violence, suicide prevention, access to sexual and reproductive health care, and school start times. We will consider how adolescent well-being is shaped by social contexts, including the role of parents and family members, peers, schools, communities, social media, and culture. We will examine policies and programs that affect adolescents, how effective they are at promoting adolescent health, and how they might be improved to better support healthy adolescent development.",202408,Family Science,Undergrad,1,Amy Lewin,30,0,30,0,2024-08-01

Soft robots have emerged as powerful alternatives for applications that would be difficult or impossible to realize using traditional, rigid robots. Despite a number of inherent benefits for soft robots, particularly in terms of safety for human-robot interactions, challenges associated with controlling the underlying fluidics of such systems represent key barriers to utility. Recently, Sochol's ""Bioinspired Advanced Manufacturing (BAM)"" Laboratory introduced a strategy for 3D printing soft robots comprising fully integrated fluidic ircuitry in a single print run and demonstrated a soft robotic ""hand"" capable of beating the first level ofSuper Mario Bros. This particular approach relied on an expensive (>$100,000) 3D printer. The goal of this project is to extend this strategy to inexpensive (e.g., <$500) 3D printers to support accessibility and demonstrate its efficacy by engineering soft robots capable of playing video games.",202408,Vertically Integrated Projects,Undergrad,1,Ryan Sochol; Kelly McNulty; Brian Dillehay,10,1,9,0,2024-08-01

HNUH268B,Global Heritage,"What traction does the past have in society today? This course explores globally how the past gains traction in society today and becomes remade in the present. That inquiry will be guided by the idea of heritage, as it mobilizes the past within a broad spectrum of social, political, economic, and environmental issues. We will examine western relationships to the past as intimately tied to property and the drive to plunder, collect, and catalogue. Increasingly, conceptions of heritage include landscapes, as well as intangibles such as music, dance, and folklore. This broad definition honors the diversity of present-day relations to the past, even as it strains heritage management models that are organized around definitions and regulations, and bear the weight of historical injustice. Close examination of heritage at work within global crisis and struggle prompts questions on who owns the past, and who owns up to it.

HNUH248C,The Societal Impact of Artificial Intelligence,"How will AI change society? AI is changing not only business, but the nature of society itself. This course investigates the nature of those changes and forecasts their future development. With a focus on the implications to business, including the nature of human jobs as AI does an increasing amount of work, students will debate the implications of AI through a variety of lenses. From definitions of consciousness and the potential for robots to claim rights to the gender implications of AI, we will explore its philosophical and political implications. As AI is also capital, we will interrogate what the advance of AI means to capitalists and for labor. Finally, we will enter the debate around whether AI will require more than machine learning to approximate general intelligence and whether it can truly be creative. Through the exploration of the unprecedented pitfalls and opportunities that AI represents, students will learn how best to cope with a world that is dependent on AI.",202408,University Honors,Undergrad,1,Roland Rust,60,1,59,0,2024-08-01

HNUH248O,We the Artificial People: How AI has Reshaped Politics,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has had profound impacts on the modern political landscape, in the US and abroad. From political campaigns powered by AI-driven audience microtargeting to AI-powered bots that influence public discourse to animosity incentivized by algorithmic content curation, AI has changed how politicians engage with the public, revealed new societal vulnerabilities, and exacerbated longstanding social ills. At the same time, these technologies empower new voices and engagement in political processes. This course encourages the critical evaluation of how AI has impacted political behavior and opened new threats like foreign electoral inference, disinformation, and manipulation through deep-fakes and generative language models. Through an exploration of key dimensions and challenges around the use of AI in political processes and methods to cope with these challenges, students will debate AI governance and frameworks for ethical, fair, transparent, and accountable AI.",202408,University Honors,Undergrad,1,Cody Buntain,20,6,14,0,2024-08-01

HNUH288B,"Race, Reproduction and Rights","Can humanity thrive without ensuring reproductive freedom? The 2022 US Supreme Court decision that the right to an abortion is unconstitutional has generated impassioned debate about women's rights and access to reproductive health care in the US and globally. This debate opens space to think beyond ""pro-choice or pro-life"" polarization and create conditions that promote equity, respect for rights, and a healthy society. These conditions would need to address injustices such as the racism, gender inequalities, marginalization, and colonization that produce disparities in reproductive health care and jeopardize the well-being of individuals, families, communities, and countries. Who controls the bodies of marginalized women and men? What is the meaning of reproductive rights for people who have little power? This course challenges students to bring together multiple disciplines, become critical data consumers, and develop innovative ways to use this knowledge to influence policy.",202408,University Honors,Undergrad,1,Sangeetha Madhavan,60,34,26,0,2024-08-01
HNUH288W,Over My Dead Body: Law and the Ethics of Healthcare,"In real time during the pandemic, we had a front-row seat to how much global healthcare can be a function not of the law but of human action. From how to prioritize populations for vaccines to individual decisions about masks, we were plunged into an almost daily discussion of the values and moral principles that guide nations and people in making choices about healthcare. This class invites students to explore their sense of right and wrong in the public healthcare debate. We will look at traditional issues such as legal paternalism, informed consent, and governmental distrust. And we will take up pressing current issues like abortion's impact on identity/privacy, disparities in marginalized communities, and biometric technologies. Students will acquire the tools to think critically think about these important issues of fairness and what our current practices reveal about society's values.",202408,University Honors,Undergrad,1,Kerry Tripp,20,3,17,0,2024-08-01

HNUH228C,The Fiction of Fact: Science as Storytelling,"What is a fact? Science is often viewed as an unbiased, fact-based, analytical discipline. However, throughout history, science has sometimes been the most potent weapon for creating and supporting political fictions and social hierarchies. Not unlike the discipline of the humanities, the sciences practice interpretation: scientists observe behaviors, of subject or objects, and necessarily provide an interpretation of the data. But it is the recourse to the ""real"" that has made science so powerful in underwriting cultural constructs. Whether we observe how science is manipulated in the public sphere, or how it is practiced for good or ill, it has been used to naturalize hierarchies of race, class or gender. Through a range of materials--fiction, film, visual arts, scientific articles, public humanities and political theses - this course will explore one of the most potent cases of this phenomenon of ""scientific"" storytelling: the case of race.",202408,University Honors,Undergrad,2,Kimberly Coles,60,36,24,0,2024-08-01
HNUH239T,Geopolitics of Finance: Innovation & Cross-Cultural Globalization,"Introduces students to the creative possibilities of the global economy: cross-cultural innovation, collaborative design-driven solutions, and enduring innovation with global purchase. Covers innovations in global business that are transforming the future through an embrace of diverse cultural perspectives. Working with interactive idealized design, out-of-the-box-thinking, and strategic exploration tools, students will explore and experience relevant design to new and cross-cultural value creation. Through rapid prototyping, immersive reflections, and innovative design activities, students will experience how to translate insight into action, and action into tangible results.

HNUH238R,"Invasive: Feminist Perspectives on Power, Politics, and Ecosurveillance","Invasive species play a key role in 60% of plant and animal extinctions, constituting a serious threat to global biodiversity and costing over $423 billion annually. But what is at stake in the impulse to frame a species as ""invasive""? What modes of watching, tracking, and surveilling emerge in the context of invasive species management? What are the material and ethical implications of these practices? As the cost of invasive species management has quadrupled every decade since 1970 and is likely to continue to increase, what alternatives exist? Reading through the lens of feminist science studies, this course asks what species movement might teach us about the possibilities and challenges of multispecies environmental ethics. Students will examine theoretical, historical, cultural, and practice-based accounts to better understand how our collective and individual actions continue to unevenly shape the biodiversity of our changing planet.",202408,University Honors,Undergrad,2,Jordan Johnson,40,31,9,0,2024-08-01

HNUH218R,"Stealing from the Poor, Giving to the Rich: The Political Economy of Global Capitalism","Street names and museum exhibits are being renamed in Europe to erase the ghosts of their colonial history. Yet, this speaks of the colonial ""era"" as the past, when in fact it is very much our present. The economic principle driving colonialism--capitalism--encouraged an insatiable appetite for territorial acquisition, human bondage, and destruction that stole wealth, life, and joy from racialized ""others"" to fuel European development. We maintain and further these thefts, oppressions, and exploitations through our purchasing habits and justify them through cultural ideas and ignorance. What would it mean to undo these oppressions? What must we understand to begin this process? This course surveys colonial capitalism and its legacies in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas, Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa to explore how history informs the present robbing of the Global South for the Global North's development, as well as pathways towards resistance and reconciliation.",202408,University Honors,Undergrad,2,Daniel Zipp,40,0,40,0,2024-08-01
HNUH248Q,"Frankenscience: An Exploration of ""Natural"" and ""Artificial"" In Society and Science Fiction","What is ""natural"" and what is ""artificial""? While this distinction might seem obvious at first, modern biology has blurred it in surprising ways. Genetic engineering, vaccination, immunotherapies, bionics, and cybernetics all combine natural and artificial components to bring new dimensions to the way we think about human health. At the same time, humans have grappled with fears and innovation through speculative fiction far longer than these ideas have had practical applications. Landmark stories of artificial life include beings in Greek mythology (Talos), Jewish lore (golem), Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and more to the present day. Approaching the interface between biological and artificial materials from both perspectives, this course will present history's cutting-edge developments in biomedical research and explore the boundaries of the natural and artificial in science fiction, allowing students to develop tools for grappling with AI and other ""Frankenscience.""",202408,University Honors,Undergrad,1,Kenneth Frauwirth,20,1,19,0,2024-08-01
HNUH268I,Origin Stories: Case Studies in American Identity,"E Pluribus Unum, the motto on U.S. currency, is one way to describe how America sees itself as a nation. Yet, the United States has always been a country of disparate, converging cultural identities brought together through circumstance and movement such as colonization, immigration, and the transatlantic slave trade. Despite unifying notions such as the melting-pot metaphor and the Pledge of Allegiance, the American experience is one that features racial and ethnic tensions, varying in intensity depending on the geopolitical context of the moment. If we say we are American, where does that shared heritage align with individual identity and where does it diverge?

HNUH278B,Democratic Habits,"How do ordinary citizens power democracy? At the age of 18, every American citizen is endowed with the right to vote, but what if democracy demands more than voting? With democratic processes seemingly in peril all around us, what can and should ordinary citizens do to safeguard democracy? Looking beyond the basic right to vote, this class will instead explore the complex ecosystem of citizenship practices necessary for collective self-governance. Turning to both philosophy and history, the course material addresses the power and peril of such civic habits as mutual aid, economic participation, tolerance, attention, organizing, protest, and more. We consider what resources these habits require, what virtues they inspire, and what happens when they conflict with each other. Students in this course will acquire the tools to develop and act on their own answer to the pressing question of what it will take to save democracy.",202408,University Honors,Undergrad,1,Kristjana Maddux,40,0,40,0,2024-08-01
HNUH248R,Artificial Intelligence: Critical Examinations through Science Fiction and Technology,"AI permeates our world, but science fiction (SF) told stories about it centuries before AI became a reality in the 1950s, shaping our understanding and expectations through words and images. In this course, students will trace AI's evolution through SF to critically examine how key SF works have shaped how we think about AI and intelligence. Through an exploration of existing AI, like autonomous weapon systems, generative AI, and AI assistants, as well as a visit to UMD's AI department, students will learn to be critical viewers, readers, and developers as they grapple with AI's moral and social implications. Using the context of SF and technological developments, we will explore what the creation, existence, and evolution of fictional and real AI means for technology and humanity.",202408,University Honors,Undergrad,2,Rebecca Jones,40,1,39,2,2024-08-01

HNUH258B,The Ecology of Childhood Poverty,"How does poverty shape the relationship between humans and their environment? It may seem obvious that being poor in childhood has enduring effects on development. What is less obvious is how experiencing poverty in childhood shapes relationships between children and their surroundings, including family interactions, peer relationships, adult dynamics, and the health of the community. Less clear still is the extent to which positive interactions with caretakers and social supports can protect children from potential harm as they grow up. This course focuses on the complexity of poverty as a social force and community concern. Students will investigate the nature of poverty through an interdisciplinary lens that includes social theory, developmental psychology, and empirical studies. After analyzing various approaches to the study of child poverty, students will be in a position to use research on parenting and poverty to evaluate public policy and social programs in their own backyard.",202408,University Honors,Undergrad,1,Natasha Cabrera,50,0,50,1,2024-08-01
HNUH278V,"Climate Change, Infectious Disease, and Civil Society","Viruses that are lethal to human life have been on earth for centuries. Why are they surging now? And how can we respond to the recent breakneck spread of Coronavirus? This class begins its journey with Homo sapiens, our ancestor that dispersed out of Africa and carried infectious diseases across the planet. Human expansion into new ecosystems also provided opportunities for us to acquire new pathogens. While all of human history is marked by diseases caused by human migration, the Industrial Revolution greatly accelerated human mobility while planting the seeds of the human impact on climate change. Today, the increasingly rapid movement of people and goods, combined with a warming planet and the large-scale disruption of major ecosystems has witnessed an unprecedented spread of infectious diseases. Students will explore how these trends impact our lives and collectively challenge themselves to do what must be done to save our planet and ourselves.",202408,University Honors,Undergrad,1,Jonathan Dinman,20,0,20,1,2024-08-01
HNUH229T,Climate in Crisis: Socio-Environmental Sustainability,"What does it mean to achieve sustainability and how does use of a socio-environmental lens help move the world in that direction? In this, the theory component of the Climate in Crisis track, students will develop an understanding of socio-environmental systems, what they have in common with other complex adaptive systems and the approaches used to study them. With a focus on why a socio-environmental systems approach can help illuminate the environmental, socio-cultural, economic, and intersectional dimensions of sustainability, we will explore what different disciplines bring to this complex topic and use qualitative and quantitative approaches to grapple with problems of sustainability. How do we work with stakeholders to identify the vulnerable, the equitable paths forward, and the trade-offs? Who are the winners and losers of policy decisions? In HNUH229P, students will complement the work of this course with hands-on engagement at the level of Federal policy and legislation.",202408,University Honors,Undergrad,1,Margaret Palmer,20,4,16,0,2024-08-01
HNUH228R,The Picture of Health and Illness: Modern Medicine in Illustration,"From prehistoric carvings, through King Tut's burial mask and Michelangelo's David, to the Lincoln Memorial and Body Worlds, images have long been used to communicate what people can and should be. After the ""Scientific Revolution"" in Europe, when identity was increasingly tied to biology, medical illustrations communicated theories of the ideal body and how it should, and should not, look. Doctors working in the midst of scientific revolution unequivocally tied health to race, gender, and sexuality by enlisting engravers, photographers, and printers to depict the healthy body as a European man and all others as weak, flawed, or ill. This course takes up questions about science, illustration, and identity. Can science tell us who we really are? Do pictures reveal the truth about our bodies? In this class, students will develop their own theory of how science continues to shape who we think we can be and how we might resist those limitations.",202408,University Honors,Undergrad,2,Brynne McBryde,40,1,39,0,2024-08-01

HNUH238C,"Surveillant Society, Surveillant Selves","Do the social and individual benefits of surveillance outweigh its risks? Surveillance is a ubiquitous practice in contemporary society. Governments surveil populations; corporations surveil customers and users; and individuals surveil themselves and others. From red light cameras and doorbell security cameras to geo-tracking apps and smart appliances, surveillant practices shape 21st-century lifestyles. Many take these practices for granted as acceptable trade-offs for individual and collective benefits. Others sound the alarm on the dangers of being tracked and monitored, with concerns over individual liberty, social inequalities, and more. In this course we will debate how surveillance shapes social practices and selves. Students will draw their own conclusions about the role of surveillance in society, and what, if anything, should be done to change it.",202408,University Honors,Undergrad,1,Brian Connor,50,1,49,0,2024-08-01
HNUH278I,"Bonded: Loneliness, Health, and Quality of Life","Society has become more and more disconnected, with 61% of American reporting being lonely. The U.S. Surgeon General's Advisory on the Healing Effects of Social Connection and Community reports that ""The mortality impact of being socially disconnected is similar to that caused by smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day, and even greater than that associated with obesity and physical inactivity."" Disconnection is devastating for health and for society. Particularly in a democracy predicated on the health of civic life, which requires interpersonal and community relationships, where does this predicament leave us as a society? This course illuminates the potential root causes of disconnection: early familial relationships, attachment styles, and broader technological trends. Students will leave the course with a toolkit of evidence-based strategies they can use - and share - to help heal these divides and repair our core social connections.",202408,University Honors,Undergrad,1,Marisa Franco,20,0,20,0,2024-08-01

How do we know where our boundaries are and how do we communicate that to others? What would it look like to create a campus community where young people are confident about their sexuality and their ability to communicate the nuances of their needs to potential partners? This course is designed as a creative workshop to help students put their own embodied knowledge in conversation with theories and practices of healthy intimacy. Core texts explore the history of sexual violence as a tool of colonization, the relationship between feminism and sex-positivity in popular culture, and the consent theories that have become central to college campus responses to sexual violence. With the help of performance-based techniques, students will have the opportunity to research issues specific to UMD, design curricula for their peers, and advocate for an end to sexual violence on campus.",202408,University Honors,Undergrad,2,K Lieder,40,15,25,0,2024-08-01

These are simple examples of collective dynamics in which small-scale interactions lead to the emergence of larger-scale patterns.

We will survey recent mathematical developments in collective dynamics. Three levels of descriptions are considered: agent-based dynamics on graphs, Vlasov-type kinetic description, and large-crowd hydrodynamics. The dynamics is governed by different protocols of pairwise interactions. Different models for such protocols of attraction, alignment, and repulsion go back to the influential works of Reynolds, Krause, Vicsek, and Cucker & Smale.",202408,Mathematics,Grad,1,Eitan Tadmor,20,16,4,0,2024-08-01

Although they lived in different times and cultures, they shared the belief that the purpose of human creation i love, and they expressed their thoughts in their love poetry. In this course, we explore the life experiences of these mystics as we read their poems in English translation. We ask questions such as ""What is experience?"", ""When can experience be called mystical?"", ""Is there a special connection between love and poetry?"", and ""Why did these thinkers express their mystical encounter with love in poetry?"".",202408,Comparative Literature,Undergrad,1,Fatemeh Keshavarz-Karamustafa,15,12,3,0,2024-08-01

A comprehensive overview of the field of behavioral endocrinology, the study of the relationship between hormones and behavior, from a psychobiological perspective. Examine the major mammalian endocrine systems, how hormones influence sex determination, how hormones underlie sex differences in brain structure and function, the role of hormones in parental and social behaviors, mood disorders, homeostasis, cognition, and stress. Both normal and abnormal hormonal pathologies will be discussed. Due to the physiological and experimental perspectives, much of the phenomenology will be based on research in species other than humans. This species comparative approach will reveal interesting ""ways of doing things"" that are intriguingly different from how ""humans do things.""",202408,Psychology,Undergrad,1,Mary Ann Rankin,35,31,4,1,2024-08-01

A comprehensive overview of the field of behavioral endocrinology, the study of the relationship between hormones and behavior, from a psychobiological perspective. Examine the major mammalian endocrine systems, how hormones influence sex determination, how hormones underlie sex differences in brain structure and function, the role of hormones in parental and social behaviors, mood disorders, homeostasis, cognition, and stress. Both normal and abnormal hormonal pathologies will be discussed. Due to the physiological and experimental perspectives, much of the phenomenology will be based on research in species other than humans. This species comparative approach will reveal interesting ""ways of doing things"" that are intriguingly different from how ""humans do things.""",202408,Biological Sciences Program,Undergrad,1,Mary Ann Rankin,35,31,4,0,2024-08-01

It was a term coined by cognitive psychologist and designer Don Norman in the 1990s on the cusp of the new digital era; however, the field in practice has existed long before that. Unfortunately, due to its over use and misuse, the pure concept of UX has become lost in the weeds and details of all of its components and methods. In this course, we will take a deep look at the true meaning of UX as simply ""a user's experience"" and what that means for you as both a designer and a user. You will learn about core UX principles and methodologies from both an academic and practical standpoint and be challenged to apply what you learn in classroom workshops and assignments. Finally, you will be asked to think both inside and outside the bounds of technology to find innovative solutions to real world design problems.",202408,Academy for Innovation & Entrepreneurship,Undergrad,1,Mira Azarm; Katherine-Aria Close,30,22,8,1,2024-08-01

HESP150,Introduction to Language Science,"Language science is the scientific study of how humans acquire, use, comprehend, and produce language. Most people in all societies learn and use their native language or languages with apparent ease - but don't be fooled: languages are highly complex, and speaking and understanding language requires some amazing feats of mental acrobatics. Thus there are many opportunities for difficulties with language, which is the focus of our field. Understanding difficulties with speech, language, and hearing require first understanding how processing works when language is successful - the psychological (behavioral) and neurobiological (brain) factors that enable people to learn and use language despite its intricacies, the structure and properties of language itself, and how knowledge of language is acquired, represented, and processed in the mind and brain.",202408,Hearing and Speech Sciences,Undergrad,1,Fathima Zuhurudeen,50,39,11,0,2024-08-01

This course will examine the main claims of the antisemites from antiquity to the present, the causes for the emergence of antisemitic invective and behavior in different periods and places, and the ways Jews devised to cope with the threat that anti-Jewish hostility posed. We will focus on primary sources as well as scholarly analyses. Hopefully we will come to understand how different societies coped with an unusual religo-ethnic minority group and how that minority group understood its place in those societies.",202408,History,Undergrad,1,Marsha Rozenblit,30,16,14,0,2024-08-01

Hatred of the Jews has a long history, stretching from antiquity to the present. Based on many causes -- religious animosity, economic challenges, racial fears, political anxieties -- antisemitism may have waxed and waned over the past two thousand years, but it has proven a remarkably resilient and often deadly concept. This course will examine the main claims of the antisemites from antiquity to the present, the causes for the emergence of antisemitic invective and behavior in different periods and places, and the ways Jews devised to cope with the threat that anti-Jewish hostility posed. We will focus on primary sources as well as scholarly analyses. Hopefully we will come to understand how different societies coped with an unusual religo-ethnic minority group and how that minority group understood its place in those societies.",202408,Jewish Studies,Undergrad,1,Marsha Rozenblit,30,16,14,0,2024-08-01

This course will introduce students to the various fundamental key aspects related to offshore wind. The first part of the course will cover the basics of meteorology related to wind and waves and then how wind turbines are able to change the translational kinetic energy in the wind into rotational kinetic energy of the blades. The second portion concerns the structures of offshore wind turbines and how they are installed. The third portion then looks at how the turbine is controlled to convert the rotational kinetic energy to electricity in a safe and efficient manner. The fourth portion specializes in the environmental and financial issues associated with offshore wind farms. Finally the longterm operations and maintenance of individual turbines and wind farms will be explored. Successful completion of this course should be sufficient to enable entry into the off shore wind industry while also encouraging the student to examine each of these five areas in more detail.",202408,"Engineering, Aerospace",Undergrad,1,James Baeder,10,10,0,0,2024-08-01

ENAE788G,Selected Topics in Aerospace Engineering; Offshore Wind Energy,This course will introduce students to the various fundamental key aspects related to offshore wind. The first part of the course will cover the basics of meteorology related to wind and waves and then how wind turbines are able to change the translational kinetic energy in the wind into rotational kinetic energy of the blades. The second portion concerns the structures of offshore wind turbines and how they are installed. The third portion then looks at how the turbine is controlled to convert the rotational kinetic energy to electricity in a safe and efficient manner. The fourth portion specializes in the environmental and financial issues associated with offshore wind farms. Finally the longterm operations and maintenance of individual turbines and wind farms will be explored. Successful completion of this course should be sufficient to enable entry into the off shore wind industry while also encouraging the student to examine each of these five areas in more detail.,202408,"Engineering, Aerospace",Grad,2,James Baeder,20,16,4,0,2024-08-01

PHPE401,Social Philosophy and Political Economy,"Examines capitalism and socialism as differing modes of economic production through several different theoretical lenses. We begin by examining capitalism and socialism as they developed historically, by looking primarily at the work of Adam Smith and Karl Marx. Then, we turn our attention to one of the most important debates in 20th century economics: to what extent rational economic calculation is possible in a socialist commonwealth. After this we turn our attention to how capitalist and socialist modes of production functioned in practice. We end by turning our attention to the ethics of capitalism and socialism: which mode of economic production is most just?",202408,"Philosophy, Politics, and Economics",Undergrad,1,Xinzhi Zhao,25,0,25,6,2024-08-01

In addition to presenting the formal models of decision making, we also discuss to what extent these mathematical theories explain social interactions. An important aspect of the course is to introduce students to the ways in which economic analysis has been applied to issues in social and political philosophy. Readings will be drawn from the literature in economics, psychology, statistics and political science, as well as philosophy.",202408,"Philosophy, Politics, and Economics",Undergrad,3,Eric Pacuit,56,0,56,6,2024-08-01
