LING260,Meaning through Language: Why are we so good at it?,"What is it about us humans and our languages that allows us to communicate in ways unmatched by other animals or powerful AI models? The question is ancient, but recent decades have seen great progress in the cognitive science of language, while expanding the diversity of languages investigated. We know much more about how languages vary, how they develop in children, how they are encoded in the mind, and relate to other domains of cognition. Major developments in statistical computation and research on animal cognition also illuminate what is (not) possible without the particular structure of the human mind. We bring this all to bear on our Big Question: What makes human language special from the viewpoint of meaning? Students will come to understand the major features of language as a vehicle for complex thought and a tool for communication. They will use this understanding in analyzing common semantic patterns and everyday conversational dynamics.",202508,Linguistics,Undergrad,1,Omar Agha; Aron Hirsch,3,0,3,0,2025-08-01

AMST628R,Seminar in American Studies; The Black Radical Tradition,"The Black radical tradition is a revolutionary impulse, a refusal of the status quo, a struggle against domination, a drive to dream and make new worlds, and a will to liberation. It emerges from Black life-often amid and against antiblackness. Propelled by this will to liberation, Black people have cultivated radical worldviews, theologies, social movements, political praxes, aesthetic principles, artforms, and ways of life. In this course, we will explore acts and articulations of this centuries-long tradition in life-writing, movement manifestoes, historical accounts, speeches, philosophy, critical theory, fiction, cinema, music, and the Black quotidian. We will study the tradition in its abolitionist, antiracist, pan-Africanist, feminist, anticolonial, anarchist, socialist, queer, futurist, pessimist, and other iterations. Among the questions we will ponder: How might the Black radical tradition provide tools and insights for confronting our current sociopolitical crises? How might we activate and participate in this tradition here and now?",202508,American Studies,Grad,1,La Marr Bruce,12,9,3,0,2025-08-01

Are things like pleasure, knowledge, beauty, or achievements ingredients of a good life? Why if so? If life can be meaningful, then it seems like it makes sense to want it to never end- it makes sense to want to be immortal. But does it? Could an immortal life be a meaning ful life? If not, then that seems to suggest that death isn't so bad. But death also seemsquite bad! What is it about death that makes it bad? Is it possible to make sense of death in a philosophically rigorous way?

Soft robots have emerged as powerful alternatives for applications that would be difficult or impossible to realize using traditional, rigid robots. Despite a number of inherent benefits for soft robots, particularly in terms of safety for human-robot interactions, challenges associated with controlling the underlying fluidics of such systems represent key barriers to utility. Dr. Sochol's laboratory introduced a strategy for 3D printing soft robots comprising fully integrated fluidic circuitry ina single print run and demonstrated a soft robotic ""hand"" beating the first level of Super Mario Bros. This approach relied on an expensive (>$100,000) 3D printer. The goal of this project is to extend this strategy to inexpensive (e.g., <$500) 3D printers to support accessibility and demonstrate efficacy by engineering soft robots capable of playing video games.",202508,Vertically Integrated Projects,Undergrad,1,Kelly McNulty; Ryan Sochol; Aralia Ramirez,6,6,0,0,2025-08-01

HNUH258R,Cultivating conservation: exploring connections between biodiversity and livelihoods,"There are a lot of ways food is harvested from land and sea before it reaches your dinner plate - not all of them are savory. In this course, we'll explore how the many livelihoods that provide us with food can also work to incorporate and rely on biodiversity conservation. What does biodiversity conservation look like in a working landscape or seascape? How do social movements align or contrast with different food production and conservation practices? And finally, how are these environments - and the people and cultures embedded in them - increasingly under threat? Through complementary aspects of social science and conservation practice, this course emphasizes not only the threats posed to unique localities and livelihoods, but also the hope of a just and sustainable dinner table. Students will leave with knowledge of the practices and skills needed to participate in transforming our food system for improved environmental and community outcomes.",202508,University Honors,Undergrad,2,James LaChance,20,19,1,0,2025-08-01

HNUH288C,Abortion in U.S. Society,"How do and can we talk about abortion in contemporary society? Civil discussion around the topic of abortion is almost non-existent between people with extremely different views in the U.S. It is such a taboo topic that an exchange of ideas can even be difficult for those with slightly different views--i.e., those who believe abortion should not be regulated by the government (more than any other health care is) and those who believe abortion should be legal and regulated by governments. Although it is an issue about which Americans care deeply, the very people who need most to talk about it seem unable to find any common ground upon which to begin. This course provides students with a solid base of knowledge needed to form opinions and engage in civil debate. Through an exploration of the different ways we talk about abortion in the U.S. and the sources of those strategies, students will learn to find their voice in the controversial topic.",202508,University Honors,Undergrad,1,Julia Steinberg,30,28,2,0,2025-08-01

HNUH248C,The Societal Impact of Artificial Intelligence,"How will AI change society? AI is changing not only business, but the nature of society itself. This course investigates the nature of those changes and forecasts their future development. With a focus on the implications to business, including the nature of human jobs as AI does an increasing amount of work, students will debate the implications of AI through a variety of lenses. From definitions of consciousness and the potential for robots to claim rights to the gender implications of AI, we will explore its philosophical and political implications. As AI is also capital, we will interrogate what the advance of AI means to capitalists and for labor. Finally, we will enter the debate around whether AI will require more than machine learning to approximate general intelligence and whether it can truly be creative. Through the exploration of the unprecedented pitfalls and opportunities that AI represents, students will learn how best to cope with a world that is dependent on AI.",202508,University Honors,Undergrad,1,Roland Rust,30,27,3,0,2025-08-01

HNUH248O,We the Artificial People: How AI has Reshaped Politics,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has had profound impacts on the modern political landscape, in the US and abroad. From political campaigns powered by AI-driven audience microtargeting to AI-powered bots that influence public discourse to animosity incentivized by algorithmic content curation, AI has changed how politicians engage with the public, revealed new societal vulnerabilities, and exacerbated longstanding social ills. At the same time, these technologies empower new voices and engagement in political processes. This course encourages the critical evaluation of how AI has impacted political behavior and opened new threats like foreign electoral inference, disinformation, and manipulation through deep-fakes and generative language models. Through an exploration of key dimensions and challenges around the use of AI in political processes and methods to cope with these challenges, students will debate AI governance and frameworks for ethical, fair, transparent, and accountable AI.",202508,University Honors,Undergrad,1,Cody Buntain,10,10,0,0,2025-08-01

HNUH268O,Sea Drinkers': Stories of Migrant Ocean Crossings in African Cinema,"""You can always get off the boat: but off the Ocean, that's something else again"", notes Alesandro Barrico in his novel Ocean Sea (1993). For decades, the phrase ""Drinking the Sea"" has been used as a metaphor to describe clandestine immigration from Africa to Europe and the dangerous risks that migrants undertake in the effort to improve their lives. Today, over 70 million people are displaced from their homelands. Using films as well as readings by leading African scholars, students will consider the depth and scope of migration and displacement. Among the key questions we will explore are: How does migration affect the storytelling of African filmmakers? Is film an effective artistic medium for influencing sociopolitical policy in countries dealing with migrant crises? Students will emerge from the course with the skills to understand clandestine migration in terms of the world's geopolitical and economic systems in which we live.",202508,University Honors,Undergrad,1,Valerie Orlando,10,10,0,0,2025-08-01

HNUH278R,Getting Graphic: Comics as Resistance,"In 2023, Maia Kobabe's graphic memoir, Gender Queer, was the most challenged book in the U.S. Often restricted due to spurious claims about corrupting children, comics have a long history of upsetting the status quo with their unique use of words and pictures. Artists from historically marginalized communities continue to shape this medium. This class examines comics, from glossy horror comics to grungy punk zines, that reject the conventional and subvert suppression. Learning experientially through DMV resources like the D.C. Punk and Indie Fanzine Archive and local comics fests, students will generate their own comics and investigate censorship and resistance.",202508,University Honors,Undergrad,2,Max Barnewitz,20,20,0,0,2025-08-01
HNUH268C,Inclusion and Exclusion: Deportation in American Life,"What is the ""American Dream"" under threat of deportation? The United States proclaims to be welcoming but ideas about sovereignty, the nation, the border, good and bad immigrants, and crime in the United States coalesce to support the retention of some people and the displacement of others from its territory. Who the US deports is related to why it deports and on whose behalf such policies are made. This course acquaints students with current theories, methodologies, and debates in the field of the Humanities to grapple with the most pressing domestic questions about immigration and deportation. A variety of frameworks and approaches including critical ethnic studies, history, social movements, and geography, will challenge students to take a position on immigration law and deportation, and their effects on different communities - on all of us.",202508,University Honors,Undergrad,1,Perla Guerrero,30,29,1,0,2025-08-01

HNUH228O,Liquid Crystals: the Secret of Life,"From Superman's Kryptonite to the Star Trek crew spending a lifetime traversing the universe, evidence of space travel has occupied science fiction for ages. Now, we are in a new era: real life is catching up with fiction. Nations have sent extended missions to the Moon and Mars, and recently the OSIRIS-Rex brought rocks and dust from the asteroid 101955 Bennu down to Earth. To understand how real life can catch up with fiction (or cannot), we look at liquid crystals, the substances that are the secret of life itself. Liquid crystals are all around and in us. They are the material used in the displays that surround us - telephones, t.v.s, and computers - and the molecules that make life possible. In short, they are essential to us and to everything else that lives. Through a study of liquid crystals and their phases, students will learn the tools to address such pressing concerns as why extremes of temperature and pressure affect life the way they do, and what we can do about it.",202508,University Honors,Undergrad,1,Luz Martinez-Miranda,10,10,0,0,2025-08-01

HNUH228C,"The Fiction of Fact: Race, Science and Storytelling","What is a fact? Science is often viewed as an unbiased, fact-based, analytical discipline. However, throughout history, science has sometimes been the most potent weapon for creating and supporting political fictions and social hierarchies. Not unlike the discipline of the humanities, the sciences practice interpretation: scientists observe behaviors, of subject or objects, and necessarily provide an interpretation of the data. But it is the recourse to the ""real"" that has made science so powerful in underwriting cultural constructs. Whether we observe how science is manipulated in the public sphere, or how it is practiced for good or ill, it has been used to naturalize hierarchies of race, class or gender. Through a range of materials--fiction, film, visual arts, scientific articles, public humanities and political theses - this course will explore one of the most potent cases of this phenomenon of ""scientific"" storytelling: the case of race.",202508,University Honors,Undergrad,2,Kimberly Coles,27,25,2,0,2025-08-01
HNUH239T,Geopolitics of Finance: Innovation & Cross-Cultural Globalization,"Introduces students to the creative possibilities of the global economy: cross-cultural innovation, collaborative design-driven solutions, and enduring innovation with global purchase. Covers innovations in global business that are transforming the future through an embrace of diverse cultural perspectives. Working with interactive idealized design, out-of-the-box-thinking, and strategic exploration tools, students will explore and experience relevant design to new and cross-cultural value creation. Through rapid prototyping, immersive reflections, and innovative design activities, students will experience how to translate insight into action, and action into tangible results. The evolutionary application of frameworks in this course culminates in a capstone project. This course is self-contained but paired with HNUH239P in the Geopolitics of Finance track, which explores how globalization has brought about fundamental changes to our daily lives by making the world more interdependent.",202508,University Honors,Undergrad,1,Gerald Suarez,20,17,3,0,2025-08-01

HNUH218R,"Stealing from the Poor, Giving to the Rich: The Political Economy of Global Capitalism","Street names and museum exhibits are being renamed in Europe to erase the ghosts of their colonial history. Yet, this speaks of the colonial ""era"" as the past, when in fact it is very much our present. The economic principle driving colonialism--capitalism--encouraged an insatiable appetite for territorial acquisition, human bondage, and destruction that stole wealth, life, and joy from racialized ""others"" to fuel European development. We maintain and further these thefts, oppressions, and exploitations through our purchasing habits and justify them through cultural ideas and ignorance. What would it mean to undo these oppressions? What must we understand to begin this process? This course surveys colonial capitalism and its legacies in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas, Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa to explore how history informs the present robbing of the Global South for the Global North's development, as well as pathways towards resistance and reconciliation.",202508,University Honors,Undergrad,2,Daniel Zipp,20,18,2,0,2025-08-01
HNUH248Q,"Frankenscience: An Exploration of ""Natural"" and ""Artificial"" In Society and Science Fiction","What is ""natural"" and what is ""artificial""? While this distinction might seem obvious at first, modern biology has blurred it in surprising ways. Genetic engineering, vaccination, immunotherapies, bionics, and cybernetics all combine natural and artificial components to bring new dimensions to the way we think about human health. At the same time, humans have grappled with fears and innovation through speculative fiction far longer than these ideas have had practical applications. Landmark stories of artificial life include beings in Greek mythology (Talos), Jewish lore (golem), Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and more to the present day. Approaching the interface between biological and artificial materials from both perspectives, this course will present history's cutting-edge developments in biomedical research and explore the boundaries of the natural and artificial in science fiction, allowing students to develop tools for grappling with AI and other ""Frankenscience.""",202508,University Honors,Undergrad,1,Kenneth Frauwirth,10,10,0,0,2025-08-01
HNUH258C,"Nature at Risk: Extinction, Consequences, and Strategies","How should we prioritize among all the species at risk of extinction? This course will grapple with the complex and consequential process of extinction from biological, geographical, and mathematical perspectives. Core themes will include the 1) nature(s) of extinction risks, 2) potential consequences of different kinds of extinction, and 3) considerations involved in setting priorities. Students will explore, handle, and analyze relevant data (e.g., evolutionary trees, species occurrence records, population censuses) to better understand extinction processes. With the aid of AI-generated hypothetical species, we will investigate hidden biases, debate the consequences of our choices, and explore possible prioritization strategies.",202508,University Honors,Undergrad,1,Bill Fagan,30,29,1,0,2025-08-01
HNUH288R,Is Black Bad for Your Health? Examining Race as a Risk Factor in Public Health,"Cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, asthma... Not only are Black Americans at higher risk for developing these life-threatening conditions, but they are also at higher risk of dying from them. In fact, Black race, unlike other racial identities, has been so consistently associated with poor health outcomes that ""Black"" is considered a risk factor--a characteristic that increases the likelihood of developing a disease--for many diseases. Can one's race alone determine their health trajectory? If race is socially constructed, how can race be a risk factor for health outcomes? This class will take up the tensions, contradictions, and seemingly illogical public health practices related to health outcomes for Black Americans and the impact of these practices on the broader community. Students will make sense of our present by examining our past--race science, eugenics, medical apartheid--and learn to disrupt the social reproduction of inequities to create a healthier society for the future.",202508,University Honors,Undergrad,2,Nicole McConico,20,18,2,0,2025-08-01

HNUH248R,Artificial Intelligence: Critical Examinations through Science Fiction and Technology,"AI permeates our world, but science fiction (SF) told stories about it centuries before AI became a reality in the 1950s, shaping our understanding and expectations through words and images. In this course, students will trace AI's evolution through SF to critically examine how key SF works have shaped how we think about AI and intelligence. Through an exploration of existing AI, like autonomous weapon systems, generative AI, and AI assistants, as well as a visit to UMD's AI department, students will learn to be critical viewers, readers, and developers as they grapple with AI's moral and social implications. Using the context of SF and technological developments, we will explore what the creation, existence, and evolution of fictional and real AI means for technology and humanity.",202508,University Honors,Undergrad,2,Rebecca Jones,20,18,2,2,2025-08-01
HNUH278C,"Riding the Korean Wave: Kdrama, Race, and Global Culture","How does culture construct our knowledge of the world and ourselves? Using Korean dramas, aka Kdramas, as a case study, this course will explore how various media negotiate blackness for global audiences. As a viral, billion-dollar art form, Kdramas provide an ideal window through which to explore recent trends in our global culture, including colorism, ""Black as cool,"" travel as consumption, and immigration. They illuminate the politics of culture. We will examine how moral panics and social dilemmas are presented in the fictitious world of ""Kdramaland,"" and how they inform our understandings of South Korean society, our own societies, and the world. Drawing on social science research by Koreans and non-Koreans alike, students will debate the ways the culture of the Korean wave reflects, reproduces, and challenges social inequities of marginalized and minoritized groups, as well as how those groups respond, to illuminate the larger global forces at work in intercultural exchange.",202508,University Honors,Undergrad,1,Chinyere Osuji,30,29,1,0,2025-08-01

HNUH268R,What Makes Land a Homeland?,"We live in a world of contested lands. The University of Maryland itself stands on the ancestral land of the Piscataway People. Around the globe, we witness conflicts over land, such as the ongoing war in the Middle East over Israel-Palestine. We hear daily about the refugee crises in Syria and the complex debates surrounding the U.S.-Mexico border. These situations raise important questions: What does it mean to truly belong to a place? How does a migrant come to see their new country as home? This course explores the histories, cultures, memories, and stories of lands left behind to understand how places become homelands. Students will examine the politics behind the making of territories and the deep connections people form with land. Through this exploration, we will center the experiences of migration and displacement, questioning how these journeys reshape our understanding of belonging and the places we call home.",202508,University Honors,Undergrad,2,Vasfiye Toprak,20,20,0,0,2025-08-01
HNUH228R,The Picture of Health and Illness: Modern Medicine in Illustration,"From prehistoric carvings, through King Tut's burial mask and Michelangelo's David, to the Lincoln Memorial and Body Worlds, images have long been used to communicate what people can and should be. After the ""Scientific Revolution"" in Europe, when identity was increasingly tied to biology, medical illustrations communicated theories of the ideal body and how it should, and should not, look. Doctors working in the midst of scientific revolution unequivocally tied health to race, gender, and sexuality by enlisting engravers, photographers, and printers to depict the healthy body as a European man and all others as weak, flawed, or ill. This course takes up questions about science, illustration, and identity. Can science tell us who we really are? Do pictures reveal the truth about our bodies? In this class, students will develop their own theory of how science continues to shape who we think we can be and how we might resist those limitations.",202508,University Honors,Undergrad,2,Brynne McBryde,20,20,0,0,2025-08-01

Governments surveil populations; corporations surveil customers and users; and individuals surveil themselves and others. From red light cameras and doorbell security cameras to geo-tracking apps and smart appliances, surveillant practices shape 21st-century lifestyles. Many take these practices for granted as acceptable trade-offs for individual and collective benefits. Others sound the alarm on the dangers of being tracked and monitored, with concerns over individual liberty, social inequalities, and more. In this course we will debate how surveillance shapes social practices and selves.

The primary objective of this course is to help students understand the reasons behind this label. To accomplish this, we will read classic and contemporary works that discuss the historical foundations of race and racially segregated communities in the United States. Then, we will critically review the large body of research that has examined various social, economic, and environmental mechanisms linking racial residential segregation to health and health disparities. By the end of this course, students will be able to identify key theoretical, conceptual, and methodological approaches, challenges, and opportunities in this literature.",202508,Sociology,Grad,1,Nicholas Smith,10,9,1,0,2025-08-01

And we study larger units of analyses, from small groups to the broader society. Topics covered include socialization, identity formation, social influence, group processes, how social processes shape individual behavior, and how human behavior shapes society.",202508,Sociology,Undergrad,1,Nicholas Smith,160,144,16,3,2025-08-01

We will examine how the racial composition of neighborhoods profoundly shapes the social, economic, and environmental conditions within communities, and how inequalities in these conditions contribute to health disparities.

Science, research, education, and evidence-based communication have never been more important, as we deal with global challenges related to climate change, pandemics, disinformation campaigns, and social unrest. The lack of trust in experts and in science combined with inequities in representation and access have exacerbated many of these problems and demonstrated the importance of engagement by scientists with the public, the media, and with decision-makers to demonstrate the value of research, science, and higher education. In this class we will focus on building the knowledge and skills of students to more effectively engage on scientific issues through communication, policy, and diplomacy through a range of mechanisms.",202508,Biological Sciences Program,Undergrad,1,Karen Lips,11,11,0,0,2025-08-01

Most people in all societies learn and use their native language or languages with apparent ease - but don't be fooled: languages are highly complex, and speaking and understanding language requires some amazing feats of mental acrobatics. Thus there are many opportunities for difficulties with language, which is the focus of our field. Understanding difficulties with speech, language, and hearing require first understanding how processing works when language is successful - the psychological (behavioral) and neurobiological (brain) factors that enable people to learn and use language despite its intricacies, the structure and properties of language itself, and how knowledge of language is acquired, represented, and processed in the mind and brain.",202508,Hearing and Speech Sciences,Undergrad,1,Fathima Zuhurudeen,50,50,0,0,2025-08-01

PORT380,"Beyond Stereotypes: Identity, Power, Representation in Brazil","In recent decades, Brazil has undergone a profound reckoning with its national identity. Mainstream discourse has historically portrayed the country as a racial democracy, where diverse groups intermingled to form a harmonious and equitable society. However, this self-fashioned myth has been eroded as competing narratives struggle to define who belongs, how power is distributed, and whose voices are represented in Brazil's diverse cultural landscape., In this course, students examine how race, class, and gender have been re-conceptualized and contested, contributing to a reexamination of Brazilian culture, national identity, and society in the 21st century. We will explore how minority-led social movements and cultural production have challenged dominant narratives and exposed underlying power hierarchies. Through critical analysis of film, literature, music, and cultural theory, we will assess the country's evolving self-narrative.",202508,Portuguese,Undergrad,1,Thayse Leal Lima,25,24,1,0,2025-08-01
