ENCE489A,Special Problems in Civil Engineering; Virtual Design and Construction Application,"As construction companies push the technology to explore new uses, Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) has moved to the forefront of large-scale construction projects in the United States. VDC teams use BIM applications for an ever-expanding array of use cases in the construction industry, including but not limited to logistics visualizations, building system clash detection, constructability, construction sequencing, building asset management, LiDAR and reality capture, construction sequencing simulation, jobsite safety assessment, QA/QC, augmented and mixed virtual reality, digital twin services, and materials takeoff and estimates. VDC processes are the future of the construction industry because the benefits include improved efficiency, reduced costs for construction, enhanced safety, increased quality, and better sustainability metrics.

This course will introduce students to advanced Building Information Modeling (BIM) applications and its critical role in Virtual Design and Construction (VDC). Students will learn how to create and manage Collaborative BIM projects across teams and how successful implementation benefits construction projects. Design team knowledge of VDC processes improves the outcome of construction projects, and students will learn how architects and engineers can positively impact construction through careful and organized BIM planning.",202412,"Engineering, Civil",Undergrad,1,Kiley Wilfong Cullen,20,15,5,0,2024-12-01
