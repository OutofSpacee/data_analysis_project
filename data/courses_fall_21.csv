AASP230,Social (In)Justice and African-American Health and Well-Being,"African Americans suffer worse outcomes than non-Hispanic whites on nearly every health measure and outcomes that link to overall well-being like depressive symptoms or homicides. Health disparities are experienced by other underrepresented minority groups, but because of the unique historic and current experiences of African Americans, the determinants and solutions to African American health disparities are unique. The premise of this course is that African American health disparities are due to social injustices perpetuated on the institutional level that have permeated the lived experiences of African Americans leading to racial disparities in health and well-being. As such, the solutions on the both policy, and community, level must have a social justice approach.",202108,African American Studies,,1,Ashley Newby,30,0,30,

AASP377,Baldwin and the Black Atlantic,"As one of the most important writers of his generation, James Baldwin articulated key truths about race and racism in the United States. His fiction and non-fiction bear witness to the cruelty of anti-black racism, while also attending to the complexities of love, hope, and community in the African-American context and the context of democracy in the United States more widely. This course focuses on Baldwin's non-fiction and its complicated relation to mid-century trends in black Atlantic theory, from the racialism of Negritude to various iterations of existentialism to post-independence notions of Pan-Africanism and Black Power. What emerges from our considerations will be a portrait of Baldwin as a writer of the particularity of African-American experience and as a vernacular intellectual dedicated to the articulation of localized forms of knowing and being, while also being attentive to the blurry borders of blackness, whiteness, and the history of anti-black racism.",202108,African American Studies,,1,John Drabinski,25,17,8,

However, the phenomenon of the Renaissance coincided with an age of global exploration, commerce, trade, and colonialism, allof which expanded the ideas of the Renaissance to every corner of Europe, the Mediterranean, the New World, and beyond. During the course we will workwith UMD s MITH (Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities), in order to create a digital humanities platform (a web page) in which we will showcase the work you will produce throughout the course. The main characteristicof the digital humanities is to employ technological tools to present humanities subjects under new light.

A course in applied econometrics that examines empirical strategies in applied microeconomic research used to estimate the effects of a policy or program on the outcomes of interest in fields like public policy, development economics, labor economics, education, marketing and corporate finance, as well as in industry and international organizations. Methods in applied econometrics with a focus on the thought experiment, the hypothetical experiment that should be used to answer the causal question of interest. A taxonomy of departures from the experimental ideal is presented, as well as the assumptions required to mimic the conditions of the unfeasible experiment from observational data. Topics include regression and matching, instrumental variables and natural experiments, differences-in-differences, change-in-changes, synthetic control methods and regression discontinuity designs.

What do clothes tell us about individuals through history? This course will explore how sociological, political, economic, artistic, ethnic, geographic, technological and other factors affect costume through the ages, and how, at the same time, fashion and personal adornment emerge not only as practical necessities and/or signs of social rank and inequality, but also as manifestations of human individuality, character, personal taste and as a critically important form of communication which is unique to humans.",202108,Arts and Humanities,,1,Misha Kachman,14,0,14,

A culture centered around playing music by long-dead European men. Elite trappings, sexist power dynamics, and gatekeeping that excludes people of color-- not to mention a concert scene devastated by the coronavirus pandemic. With all these problems, can classical music in the United States be fixed? This course asks students to examine, and attempt to solve, the troubles that have beset classical music today. It will also show why the genre has nevertheless endured: the deep value that musicians continue to find in compositions that are hundreds of years old, and the power that music can still carry in the twenty-first century.",202108,Arts and Humanities,,1,William Robin,14,2,12,

One of the most remarkable of those transformations in the visual arts of the west involved the revival of the interest in the Greco-Roman mythology in the early modern era (15th- 17th centuries). In this course, we explore how those classical myths were appropriated for new uses - or given new meanings by visual artists working in various European countries, from Italy and France, to Spain and Holland.",202108,Art History & Archaeology,,1,Aneta Georgievska-Shine,25,0,25,

The portrait--along with the changes in its forms, popularity, and uses--is a guide into the history of the concept of the human being. This graduate seminar considers the long history of portraiture, with anemphasis on modern and contemporary developments. While looking closely at individual works of art, we will also consider changing beliefs regarding individualism, social collectivity, power, gender, race, soulfulness, belonging, etc. Students are invited to write research essays situated in any time period and any part of the world.",202108,Art History & Archaeology,,1,Joshua Shannon,9,0,9,

Armed with this framework, students will explore the role of social media in legitimizing hate groups (e.g., Holocaust denial) and facilitating foreign information operations (e.g., Russian election interference and Iranian Impersonator Operations). Finally, we will examine efforts by Facebook, Twitter and other media outlets to counter the spread of misinformation, and discuss the effectiveness of current strategies (e.g., fact-checking, improving media literacy, examining source credibility).

From this perspective, other questions arise: How can we design policies that incentivize sustainable choices? Why might usual market functioning fail to achieve sustainability? Do we need to put a price on the environment in order to protect it? How do we measure an economy's ""success""?

This course examines how cities work, and importantly, whether they work the same for everyone living in the city. We will explore the ways in which we provide city services and who is included or excluded from these services. We will examine how the city infrastructure serves a neighborhood's residents, with an eye toward how community forms. We will use first person accounts from policymakers, advocates, and community members to learn about the planning process for services and the tensions that can exist around access to healthcare, food and affordable housing. Each week we will study a new facet of the city, drawing on the writings of experts and your own journey through the city to better understand its infrastructure, asking how does it work, how does it connect to other infrastructure and whom does it primarily serve?",202108,"Engineering, Civil",,1,Deb Niemeier,40,13,27,

At the same time, we are coming to appreciate the increasingly complex nature of technological systems as they become integrated into all forms of infrastructure, we realize they may be unpredictable, interdependent on social and biological systems, and have unintended consequences. In this midst of this complexity, people make decisions with far reaching impacts. How then do we follow our passion for technology and innovation but also stay skeptical in a way that allows us to consider the potential and shortcomings of technology? Designed for both engineering and non-engineering students wishing to explore and assess the impact of engineering technology on society and the role of society in generating that technology.",202108,Electrical & Computer Engineering,,10,Timothy Reedy; Nicole Mogul,152,8,144,

HESP150,Introduction to Language Science,"Language science is the scientific study of how humans acquire, use, comprehend, and produce language. Most people in all societies learn and use their native language or languages with apparent ease - but don't be fooled: languages are highly complex, and speaking and understanding language requires some amazing feats of mental acrobatics. Thus there are many opportunities for difficulties with language, which is the focus of our field. Understanding difficulties with speech, language, and hearing require first understanding how processing works when language is successful - the psychological (behavioral) and neurobiological (brain) factors that enable people to learn and use language despite its intricacies, the structure and properties of language itself, and how knowledge of language is acquired, represented, and processed in the mind and brain.",202108,Hearing and Speech Sciences,,1,Krista Voelmle,50,22,28,

HNUH218X,"Uprising, Riot, Revolt: Violence in Story and Theory","How does violence connect to revolution? Is violence the result of lone wolf actors, oppressive social structures, or just blind fate? Is it a side-effect of revolution or its driving force? Is violence a way to fight injustice, or is it a problem of evil? Why is one person's uprising another person's riot? In this seminar, we will explore literature, politics, and religion to debate the meaning and causes of violence. By examining the writings of a prison psychiatrist, historians, activists, theorists, and theologians alongside classic and contemporary literary works, we will disrupt common understandings of violence. In conducting interviews with community members, engaging in classroom debate, and sharing ideas in a project-poster session, we will investigate violence in the UMD community and wider DC area, and propose ways toward revolutionary change.",202108,University Honors,,2,Margaret Elwell,40,16,24,
HNUH218Y,"The Science, Economics, and Governance of Climate Change: The Need For An Energy Revolution","Hardly a day goes by without some news worthy item being reported on Earth's changing climate. Often the stories are contradictory, tainted by parochialism and extremism, not only by the conservative and liberal media, but also by the camps of so-called believers and deniers. This seminar will begin with a review of the history of how decisions regarding human interactions with the environment have either doomed past societies to failure, or enabled long-term, sustainable success. Next we'll examine the science that underlies global warming, in a manner accessible to non-scientists, as well as the potential consequences of a rapidly changing climate. We will then discuss the economics of large-scale provision of energy by renewable resources, which will be needed to avert climate catastrophe. During the final few weeks of this seminar, students will break into three groups, representing various parts of the world, and negotiate an international plan to transition the world energy supply to renewable resources that emit little or no greenhouse gases.",202108,University Honors,,1,Ross Salawitch,20,9,11,
HNUH219P,Transform Maryland: Theories into Practice,"In this intensive, 10-person seminar, students undertake a real-world consulting engagement for their client, the University of Maryland, to improve one of its operational processes. Working as a consulting team, students apply analysis, user-centered design, behavioral and social science methods in order to identify opportunities for innovation and recommend solutions. The one-semester engagement is broken into four phases--Frame, Explore, Analyze, and Recommend--through which students assess the potential for changing operations, addressing political differences, and the potential for technology to augment the streamlined process. The practicum focuses on transforming critical university administrative and business functions and culminates in a presentation to key members of the University of Maryland leadership team.

HNUH228A,Peace in our time? Conflict and Conflict Resolution in International Politics,"Is the world getting more peaceful? There are currently civil wars raging in much of the world and millions of people have fled these wars as refugees or internally displaced persons. Terrorist attacks kill thousands, and can occur in any corner of the planet. At the same time many actors use strategies such as peacekeeping, mediation, promotion of human rights and post-conflict justice to resolve conflicts and build peace. In this course, we will examine conflict, peace, and conflict resolution in contemporary international politics. We will interrogate concepts such as peace, conflict, and violence, the different forms that these phenomena can take, and how we can measure their occurrence. We will discuss theoretical explanations for why individuals and groups have disputes and why these actors choose to use violence (or not) in these disputes and examine these arguments in specific cases. We will analyze conflict resolution strategies such as mediation, peacekeeping, and human rights promotion both theoretically and empirically. This discussion will allow students to develop an argument for whether the world is getting more peaceful, why it is or is not, and what this could mean about the future of violence and peace.",202108,University Honors,,1,David Cunningham,60,13,47,
HNUH228Y,Interrogating Issues of Piracy/Pirates amidst the Shadowy Landscapes of War & Peace,"Who are pirates and what constitutes piracy in a given era? To what extent do changing notions of piracy reflect major societal transformations at the national, regional and global levels, as well as reveal the contested and often overlapping boundaries of war and peace? How can we use pirates/piracy as a ""tool"" to engender an historical, economic, political, social, and cultural understanding of global forces and change? Do the legends and myths surrounding infamous pirates represent the realities and relationships of early and new forms of piracy? Could piracy be conceived as a form of counterculture? To what extent do piracy, rivalry, state building, war-making, peace-making all belong on the same continuum? This course examines pirates/piracy as an integral part of major global processes. We will investigate when and why piracy emerged and flourished, and how lawbreakers and lawmakers relate to one another on the murky terrains of power, then explore alternative ways to (re)configure who is a pirate and what constitutes piracy, especially within the dynamics of today's neo-liberal globalization.",202108,University Honors,,2,Dorith Grant-Wisdom,40,7,33,
HNUH229P,Climate in Crisis: Strategy and Advocacy,"This theory and practice track examines theoretical frameworks for understanding climate change and concrete cases that shed light on the complexity of managing it. In this, the practical component of the Climate in Crisis track, we explore several domestic energy and climate policy case studies, examining the competing roles played by various interest groups that influence legislative and regulatory outcomes, with a focus on differing organizational advocacy strategies. Once we have mastered organizational advocacy strategies, students bring those tools to bear on the most recent US Federal policy mandates and legislation. In 229T, students will complement this work with a deep dive into the nature of public goods and climate change policy, among other crucial considerations.",202108,University Honors,,1,Tyson Slocum,20,1,19,
HNUH229T,Climate in Crisis: Politics and Ethics,"This theory and practice track examines theoretical frameworks for understanding climate change and concrete cases that shed light on the complexity of managing it. In this, the theoretical component of the Climate in Crisis track, we investigate the nature of global public goods and questions about how best to provide them in a situation of multiple actors (states, NGOs, local and indigenous communities); climate change policy and justice; and the intersection of climate change with concerns about biodiversity conservation, food security, migration, and local development. Learning from this broad range of material gives students the complex perspective they need to grapple with the climate crisis. In 229P, students will complement this work with hands-on engagement at the level of Federal policy and legislation.",202108,University Honors,,1,Thomas Hilde,20,4,16,
HNUH238A,Deliberative Democracy,"How do we change our politics, save democracy, and move beyond the ""us vs. them"" culture that divides us? This course begins with the premise that how we talk to one another and debate controversial issues can promote the public good or erode it in irreparable ways. Students in each class session will put principles of public dialogue into practice as they learn deliberative theories and skills that can help save democracy. Class readings will turn to historical case studies to frame the most controversial political issues we face today.",202108,University Honors,,1,Shawn Parry-Giles,60,14,46,
HNUH238Y,Information Weaponization: Thinking Critically in a Changing World,"Contemporary challenges--such as climate change, food, energy and water security, and deadly virus transmission--demand that people think critically. These challenges are often complex and interrelated; for example, society's increasing demand for energy contributes to human-induced climate change, which in turn, limits freshwater and food supplies, and which in turn, could contribute to the worldwide spread of disease. While many societal challenges are seriously impacting local, regional and global communities, an increasing availability of information has contributed to what many call a ""Post-Truth Era,"" where emotions and personal beliefs override scientifically valid evidence and explanations. We will consider the institutional use of post-truth a form of information weaponization. This course asks how information weaponization impacts the evaluation of valid lines of evidence and explanations. How do we evaluate and what is needed to improve individuals' evaluations of claims in the post-truth era? Combatting mythological and unproductive thinking in the face of current change requires increased digital literacy. We will learn enhanced reasoning, evaluation skills, and critical thinking.",202108,University Honors,,1,Doug Lombardi,20,1,19,
HNUH238Z,Learning as Deliberation: The Struggle for the Future of Public Education,"This seminar invites students to deliberate about the historical roots of the policies and politics of public education in the United States. We will study how ideas about merit, democracy, and equity (or lack thereof) have shaped decisions about what public education should offer and to whom. We will look to alternative traditions of learning and study how these traditions have challenged and complemented public education. As we explore theories and practices of the past and present, students will learn to articulate and advocate for their own priorities in public higher education as 21st-century citizens of UMD. This course uses project based pedagogy. Students will create a proposal for teaching a facet of American History (Pedagogical Design Project) and engage in peer critique (presentation Q&A) to hone their critical skills.",202108,University Honors,,1,Robert Chiles,20,5,15,
HNUH248A,"Identity, Places, & Spaces","Students in this interdisciplinary course will explore multi-layered issues related to privilege and oppression through their own life experiences via exposure to theory, research, film, memoirs, and current events. Students will evaluate and critique common assumptions about the meaning and experiences of privilege and oppression using Intersectionality theory as a guiding framework. The human experience related to various social identities (i.e., race, gender and gender identity, sexual orientation, social class, religion, age, and ability) will be addressed.",202108,University Honors,,1,Mia A Smith-Bynum,60,0,60,
HNUH248X,"My Hometown, Our Wilderness: Ecology of Identity","What has been the setting of your life? Suburbs? Cities? A farm? We may be used to thinking of environments as equal access across society, since everyone is free to visit our National Parks or spend a day at the beach. But there are striking ways in which identity affects our habitat. Race, class, gender, sexual preference, and other markers have strong influences on where we spend our time, what we eat, and how we work and relax. Suburbs, cities, wilds, and farms are not just physical places, they exhibit histories of social inclusion and exclusion. For example, the money and free time of affluent Americans serves as a portal to leisure spaces that would be inaccessible to working-class Americans who lack the ability to take time off, drive or fly long distances, and pay for it all. We'll profile identity ecology through the poetry of African American urban naturalists, essays of wilderness-loving men like Edward Abbey, the comedy of white environmental outrage, and the racialized class tensions in resorts like Aspen, CO. This survey will support your in-depth personal exploration of identity ecology in a collaborative video media project.",202108,University Honors,,2,Heidi Scott,40,2,38,
HNUH248Y,"How Do You ""Man Up?"": Men, Masculinity, and Mental Health","In August 2018, the American Psychological Association released guidelines regarding the best practices for researchers and mental health professionals when working with boys and men. Many reacted with the question, ""are we treating masculinity as a mental health issue?"" This course aims to answer that question by taking a historical perspective on how American society has viewed masculinity from the beginning of psychology as a field of study until present day. An intersectional approach will be taken to better understand how race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, and socioeconomic status impact men and masculinity. We will address the questions: How does one prove their manhood? How much of masculinity is biological versus socialized? What experiences are unique to men? And how do psychologists and mental health professionals understand and address mental health concerns among men?",202108,University Honors,,1,Monica Kearney,20,0,20,
HNUH258A,Harvesting Big Data to Examine Agriculture and Climate Change,"Can agricultural production keep up with climate change? Data analytics and data science are driving the force behind the digital revolution, which has changed the way we are able to analyze and interpret the world. The explosion of data offers both opportunities and challenges that require new tools and methods of analysis. This course applies sophisticated digital tools to an age-old concern: the impact of environmental change and extreme weather on agricultural productivity. In this hands-on introduction to data analysis and visualization with real-world data, students acquire the tools to understand the impacts of environmental change and more.",202108,University Honors,,1,Lars Olson,60,4,56,
HNUH258X,"Carnal Knowledge: Health, Data, and Power from Enlightenment to WebMD","""Carnal knowledge"" may sound provocative but, in a literal sense, it describes information derived from and about the human body. Consider a ship captain observing the tattoos of sailors to understand their origins, a surgeon examining a cadaver for signs of saintliness, or a natural philosopher ingesting an herb to determine its toxicity. These are instances of carnal knowledge. Historically, such intimate acts turned the body into a site of data collection and a powerful source of information. Both by choice and by force, the instrumentalization of the human body was used to solve scientific problems as well as to justify hierarchies of race and sex. Through a deep engagement with this material, students will connect topics such as the transatlantic slave trade to cell lines as they uncover the embodied relationship between information and power that still shapes our world today.",202108,University Honors,,2,Zachary Dorner,40,0,40,
HNUH268A,"Arbitrating our Bodily Rights: Consent to Sex, Medical Treatment, Body Art, Organ Donation, and Research Participation","Both American law and conventional morality support the view that human beings have bodily rights - ones we can waive by giving another person our consent to do what would otherwise be a rights violation. Yet, debate about the sovereignty of an individual's body and the potential rights of others--including the state--over our bodies lies at the core of some of the most contentious issues facing us as a society. This class will investigate the thorny debates that pertain to consent in sexual relations, medicine and research, and bodily markets. What types threats, offers, or cognitive incapacities undermine true consent? How do we evaluate the moral or legal significance of bodily rights when they come into tension with the government's interest? After evaluating arguments, exploring distinctions, and using philosophical tools to arrive at reasoned conclusions about consent, students will learn to apply these conceptual tools to cases from fiction and current events.",202108,University Honors,,3,Hallie Liberto,60,0,60,
HNUH268X,Sex for Sale: Prostitution in Transnational Perspective,"Can sex be sold? Is prostitution work or violence, and who gets to decide if it is legal or illegal? The sex industry has provoked considerable debate in academia, policy circles, and aid organizations globally. This interdisciplinary seminar will engage with these debates through an exploration of histories of prostitution across time and space, and in a variety of theoretical and material contexts. Our main focus will be on the nineteenth- and twentieth-century U.S., Europe, and the Middle East, but we will also explore cases from Asia, Latin America, and Africa. We will use this transnational lens to interrogate social and cultural assumptions about bodies, agency, and social institutions. We will also consider a variety of social movements from anti-prostitution to SlutWalks, and regulatory policies from criminalization to legalization, and how they intersect with race. This course invites students to move beyond the surface and form their own approach to these body politics.",202108,University Honors,,2,Fatemeh Hosseini,40,4,36,

HNUH278X,A Way with Words: Order and Knowledge in Enlightenment Europe,"""Without language, things cannot well be expressed or published to the World,"" wrote Edward Phillips in The New World of English Words (1658). In this course, we will interrogate the power of words to communicate and classify, to impose meaning and order in the historical moment that brought about many of our modern institutions and ways of thinking: the European Enlightenment. From the binomial taxonomies with which Linnaeus ordered ""chaos and confusion"" to the racist taxonomies deployed to reinforce inequities, we will survey how language facilitated the consolidation of European power at home and abroad. We will further develop the visual literacy to decode how images convey knowledge. Looking back to the period that gave shape to many modern languages, institutions, and divisions of knowledge, we will be poised to face today's crises.",202108,University Honors,,2,Lauren Cannady,40,20,20,

Through a hands-on exploration of deep fakes and the alteration of text and image, this course will give students the practical skills they need to verify information and fact check.

HNUH288A,"Welcome to the Party: Race, Nightlife, and Identity in America","How does play shape our humanity and national identity? We often define people by the work that they do, whereas we tend to think of leisure and after work playfulness as a release from that identity. This course takes up a particular form of play--nightlife--to reckon with how it shapes what it means to be human and how it impacts nationhood, particularly around matters of race and oppression. Spanning from slavery to the present, this course examines how nightlife has been used to deny black people's humanity and been a vital site of playfulness, manifest as joy, resistance, self-making, and aesthetic innovation. Using performance studies to make sense of the world, our explorations will range from cakewalk dance competitions on plantations to queer night clubs. Once students better understand how nightlife is vital to the making and the unmaking of black people's humanity, they will grapple with play as a meaning-maker in their own lives and in our democracy.",202108,University Honors,,1,Julius Fleming,60,8,52,

In the digital world designed by and for human beings, all sorts of actors imitate people, while people are objectified through surveillance and data mining. Despite a frequent distinction between the internet and 'IRL,' physical bodies are wrapped up in every aspect of existence online: from the factory workers who build our technology to the postures and gestures those devices require us to adopt. Exploring this range of bodily phenomena, this course considers what constitutes a ""human body"" online and how digitality and connectivity inform our understanding of personhood. From RPGs and dance challenges to AI and visceral responses to internet content, students will analyze the complex relationships between the technological and the embodied, the social and the political, the past and the future.",202108,University Honors,,2,Alexandra Harlig,40,9,31,

Non-human animals can be consumed as food, used for scientific research, and treasured as companions. They are commercialized, worshipped, and stereotyped. Our complex relationships with other animals emerge from and fuel debates about what makes ""us"" different from ""them."" In this course, we will ask (and attempt to answer) questions such as: What roles do we open to (or force on) non-human animals in American culture and why? Who makes these decisions and what is their effect on animal life? We will explore the evolution of modern human-animal relationships to contextualize major social and scientific debates that have arisen in the last century, including what it means to be human in this context, and why they matter.",202108,University Honors,,1,Halli Weiner,20,17,3,

HONR218R,The Quest for Color,"Finding sources of color in nature has motivated mindful inquiry and technical innovation across cultures. Yet, the quest for new colors has been both a result of and an excuse for colonization, appropriation of indigenous knowledge, and enslavement. When natural dyestuffs were largely replaced by synthetic dyes derived from coal tar in the late 1800s, color development posed new ecological and cultural challenges. In spite of these threats, practitioners worldwide have maintained their traditional methods without exploitation or petroleum products. This course integrates the history and chemistry of dye materials from plants and insects with hands-on practice in sustainable color creation. Students will hone the practical skills needed to source and process foraged dye materials, and apply them sustainably to fibers. Via this scientific process students will gain insight into the benefits of a naturally sourced approach to color and to life.",202108,Honors,,1,Maile Neel,20,13,7,

What does ""User Experience"" mean? It was a term coined by cognitive psychologist and designer Don Norman in the 1990s on the cusp of the new digital era; however, the field in practice has existed long before that. Unfortunately, due to its over use and misuse, the pure concept of UX has become lost in the weeds and details of all of its components and methods. In this course, we will take a deep look at the true meaning of UX as simply a user's experience and what that means for you as both a designer and a user. You will learn about core UX principles and methodologies from both an academic and practical standpoint and be challenged to apply what you learn in classroom workshops and assignments. Finally, you will be asked to think both inside and outside the bounds of technology to find innovative solutions to real world design problems.

We also look at information avoidance, health behaviors, health literacy, digital health literacy, doctor-patient communication, and patient- to-patient communication. Throughout the course, we emphasize the importance of health justice - a world in which everyone has an adequate and equitable capability to be healthy. We will identify populations that experience social injustice and explore information-related factors that contribute to the health inequities they face and the resulting consequences. Our central aim in the course is to conceive of ways to facilitate people's access to health information and their health-related information seeking, and to promote health justice for all.",202108,Information Studies,,1,Beth St Jean,30,28,2,

Not only health care providers are relying on Health Technologies to improve patient care, people are increasingly using health devices and apps in their everyday life. Individuals have started using new technologies to collect data, increase awareness, and reflect on and change their behaviors. They also use various tools for curiosity and fun. This course will provide an overview of this exciting field and examine how social and behavioral theories can be applied to create effective health applications.It is difficult to create health technologies that can successfully be integrated into people's daily life due to many obstacles in individuals' data collection, integration, self-reflection, and sharing practices. Understanding these challenges is an important part of designing Health Technologies. Therefore, this course will cover HCI and design thinking methods that you can leverage in understanding the adoption of Health Technologies. Moreover, visualizations facilitate people to gain insights from their data, so we will cover common visualization approaches used in the personal data contexts.",202108,Information Studies,,1,Eun Kyoung Choe,30,5,25,

Many think that democracy is the only acceptable form of government, but it is hard to articulate why. This course will look at normative arguments in defense of democracy. It will also look at criticisms of these arguments, along with normative arguments in favor of non-democratic forms of government. The course will also look at theoretical and empirical work concerning how democracies actually function in the real world (e.g., the median voter theorem, the Hong-Page theorem, McKelvey Schofield chaos theorem, etc.), and ask how this theoretical and empirical work should inform our normative arguments for democracy.",202108,Philosophy,,1,Brian Kogelmann,30,0,30,

Markets are pervasive throughout our lives, but we rarely think about them from an ethical perspective. This course examines questions at the intersection of ethics and markets. It asks questions like: what is the extent of permissible market exchange? What sorts of things can be bought and sold on the market? Do markets corrupt our morals? Do markets presuppose certain morals? Does trade between nations lead to tolerance? What are the social responsibilities of business?",202108,Philosophy,,1,Antong Liu,30,13,17,
PHIL408K,Topics in Contemporary Philosophy; Theories of Meaning,"Prerequisite: One PHIL course or permission of instructor.

Humans can think about things and events in the external world, including those that are very remote. We have beliefs about Pluto, couches, the weather, and our moral obligations, to name a few. This is an obvious, but remarkable fact---and arguably, one that sets humans aside from animals like ants or mosquitoes. Philosophers have raised a number of questions about it: what does it take to have a capacity to represent the world outside of us? How is this capacity related to the capacity to draw inferences, and how is it related to consciousness? Can we have a science of meaning, in the same way as we have, for example, a science of the brain? This course will address these and related questions, focusing on contemporary work in philosophy, linguistics, and cognitive science.",202108,Philosophy,,1,Paolo Santorio,30,25,5,

PHIL478,"Topics in Philosophical Logic; The Logic of Classes, Types, and Properties, and its Applications","This course introduces core logical frameworks for the logic of classes, types, and properties, as well as their main application. For example, these logical systems allow us to model inferences such as the one from ""That cow is courageous"" and ""That horse is not courageous"" to the conclusion ""That cow is something that the horse is not."" In particular, the course presents three frameworks for thinking about classes: set theory, second-order logic and type theory. After a main block of ten weeks on these, the class will consider three kinds of application: (1) philosophical applications of higher-order logic in metaphysics; (2) linguistic applications of type theory in semantics; (3) applications of type theory in computer science, with particular attention to the foundations of programming languages. Students will be expected to have rough familiarity with each of these three applications, but to pursue only one in depth according to their background and interests.",202108,Philosophy,,1,Fabrizio Cariani,30,22,8,

In addition to presenting the formal models of decision making, we also discuss to what extent these mathematical theories explain social interactions.

After this we turn our attention to how capitalist and socialist modes of production functioned in practice.

The construct of ""neighborhood"" is explored throughout the course as both a social organizing principle and as an economic marketplace. Neighborhoods are considered throughout the historical forces that have shaped them, reaching back to the original formation of ethnic and racial ghettos and moving forward through urban renewal and modern-day gentrification. The changing forms of the real estate projects that have sustained these neighborhoods over time are evaluated . As changes further continued in neighborhoods and altered perceived demands for housing and services, the factors that changed the viability of real estate projects are closely investigated. The course also considers the government and policy landscapes that have helped shape neighborhood form and the real estate types found there. These policies are understood through review of actual case examples.",202108,Real Estate Development,,1,Instructor: TBA,15,15,0,

WGSS488C,Senior Seminar; Debt Threats: The Cultural Politics of US Capitalism,"Restriction: Permission of the Harriet Tubman Department of Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies.

Debt is a topic that makes news headlines regularly: politicians propose plans to eliminate student debt, the national debt rises, and debt is hampering access to medical care. Debt is deepening inequalities, and while it has been a focus for scholars of economics, it is also increasingly a concern for those who study US culture. In this seminar, we marshal recent scholarship from Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies to understand how debt functions, whom it fails, and what it says about economic inequality and its relationship to race and gender in the contemporary US. We work together to understand the moral charge of debt and we ask how ideas about personal responsibility circulate. We study topics including imprisonment, reparations, the relationship of debt and environmental disaster, student debt, and the work of anti-debt activists.",202108,"Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies",,1,Jaime Madden,15,8,7,
