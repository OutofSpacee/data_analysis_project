Topics will include the distinction between the rhetorical/probabilistic structure of Renaissance humanistic antiquarianism and modern scientific archaeology; the humanistic philological methods employed in the interpretation of ancient iconography; the politicization of ancient art; the purpose of artists drawings after the antique; the notably unscientific thinking that informed the restoration of fragmentary ancient works; the problem of perceived cultural and artistic continuities between ancient Rome and Renaissance Italy; the relationship between seventeenth-century Roman Classicism and later eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Neoclassicism; the recovery and interpretation of ancient painting; and the use of plaster casts in academic art education.",202208,Art History & Archaeology,,1,Anthony Colantuono,9,3,6,

A comprehensive overview of the field of behavioral endocrinology, the study of the relationship between hormones and behavior, from a psychobiological perspective. Examine the major mammalian endocrine systems, how hormones influence sex determination, how hormones underlie sex differences in brain structure and function, the role of hormones in parental and social behaviors, mood disorders, homeostasis, cognition, and stress. Both normal and abnormal hormonal pathologies will be discussed. Due to the physiological and experimental perspectives, much of the phenomenology will be based on research in species other than humans.

How short can a story be and still stand as a complete and meaningful creation? In animation, where every second consists of 25 handmade frames, the idea of short is brought to its extreme. Students will explore the structures of short stories and short animation films, with particular attention to Jewish and Israeli examples. Students will observe the basic elements that turn a short occurrence into a story and will practice live storytelling to experiment with different approaches to the narrator's role and the tension between text and image.

From this perspective, other questions arise: How can we design policies that incentivize sustainable choices? Why might usual market functioning fail to achieve sustainability? Do we need to put a price on the environment in order to protect it? How do we measure an economy's ""success""?

HBUS100,The Future of Work: Interdisciplinary Foundations and Horizons of Business,"This course begins with foundations in both the history and evolution of business functions and processes and the role of business in the general health and welfare of the United States and the world. It then considers the future of business and work from a critical and multidisciplinary perspective, involving a wide array of technological, information access, macroeconomic, governmental and political, legal, socially responsible, environmental, personal and interpersonal dimensions. The future of work is particularly dynamic in view of rapid changes in technological developments, artificial intelligence, automation, information access, public health conditions, and social and environmental justice demands. These conditions are explored in relation to questions of socially responsible practices in business that respect employee rights, promote ethical conduct, involve new forms of media and global coordination, address diversity and equity concerns, protect the environment, and respond to new ways of thinking, feeling, and critically engaging the world by all individuals involved in various ways and capacities with business. This course provides an overview of these topics relying on senior faculty to ensure that students, as they develop a critical and multidisciplinary sense of the future of work and business, also engage in critical introspection about themselves in considering their skills, interests, and goals.",202208,Interdisciplinary Business Honors,,1,Joseph Bailey,65,3,62,

HESP150,Introduction to Language Science,"Language science is the scientific study of how humans acquire, use, comprehend, and produce language. Most people in all societies learn and use their native language or languages with apparent ease - but don't be fooled: languages are highly complex, and speaking and understanding language requires some amazing feats of mental acrobatics. Thus there are many opportunities for difficulties with language, which is the focus of our field. Understanding difficulties with speech, language, and hearing require first understanding how processing works when language is successful - the psychological (behavioral) and neurobiological (brain) factors that enable people to learn and use language despite its intricacies, the structure and properties of language itself, and how knowledge of language is acquired, represented, and processed in the mind and brain.",202208,Hearing and Speech Sciences,,1,Fathima Zuhurudeen,50,36,14,

HNUH218B,Frederick Douglass's America,"What does it mean to be free in the United States? The concept of freedom was embedded in the nation's political culture in the Declaration of Independence, and it has remained a cherished and contested ideal. We can interrogate this concept through the life and times of Frederick Douglass (1818-1895), who dreamed eloquently of freedom, thought carefully about its limits, and worked ardently to build a firmer freedom for a broader population. With Douglass as our guide, we will examine the survival of slavery in a nation built on freedom, images of the expanding United States as a land of opportunity, and the complex meanings and tremendous costs of freedom struggles during the nineteenth century. This history will push you to think critically about the contested concepts that shape our lives, and to consider the values and the perils of a society that positions freedom as its highest ideal.",202208,University Honors,,3,Christopher Bonner,60,22,38,
HNUH218U,Finding Feminist Freedom,"""I'm the one that'll make you pay."" So goes one verse of what has become a Latin American feminist hymn, ""Cancion sin miedo"" (""Fearless Song,"" by Vivir Quintana). Transnationally, feminists today--particularly in the Global South--are on fire: militant, unafraid, angry, and, above all, driven by a desire to build a world where the promise of freedom for all is finally fulfilled. But what is freedom? Is freedom an abstract concept or a lived experience? Is it individual or collective? What is the meaning of 'feminist freedom'? These questions will be gauged by discussing, analyzing, and interpreting texts in feminist theory; decolonial and transnational feminist approaches; and feminist film, documentary, performance, and protest. At the end of the course, you will have learned that there is not one feminism, but many, become familiar with feminist theory and practice, and be equipped to live your own version of a feminist life.",202208,University Honors,,2,Veronica Zebadua-Yanez,40,6,34,
HNUH218V,Black Bodies and Green Spaces: From 1619 to Today,"From the antebellum plantation slave, who used uncultivated land as a place of deliverance, healing and route to freedom, to the Central Park bird watcher, whose green space presence was perceived as a threat to White physical safety, black bodies have a vexed relationship to green space. This course critically examines how systemic racism has shaped the experience, connection, and relationship to nature among Black Americans. Students will conduct in-depth analysis, critical thinking, and discussion on topics ranging from slavery and nature; The Great Migration; and Jim Crow, segregation, and parks; to green space inequity and ""Moving While Black"" (Treyvon to Ahmaud). While some environments (built, natural, virtual) within the United States have represented the essence of anti-Black racism and indignity, this course will further explore how many Black Americans still regarded nature as a space of freedom, humanity, and spirituality.",202208,University Honors,,1,Jennifer Roberts,20,16,4,

HNUH228B,Redesigning Life: Prospects and Consequences,"What is at stake for our world as humans seek to redesign biological organisms? Biotechnology advances are enabling us to read, edit and write genomes, including our own. This revolution has been fueled by the quest to understand and cure disease. Yet, these innovations have far-reaching consequences beyond medicine and will reshape our world in ways we can only imagine - or fear. The course will challenge students to confront the risks and rewards for them, their family, their community, and their future, as biotechnology moves out of specialized laboratories and into homes. A demystifying, low-tech approach will introduce them to contemporary genome redesign, clarifying the current limitations and future goals of the field. Students will debate whether redesigning plants and animals will enhance or inhibit momentum in human genome engineering, and formulate their own arguments about who should be able to use these tools and where, who decides, and how much society is willing to risk.",202208,University Honors,,1,Edward Eisenstein,60,0,60,
HNUH228U,A Life Worth Living: The Legacy of Eugenics in Genetics,"Should parents be able to choose their child's eye color? Or alter their child's genome to eliminate a hereditary disability? While these might seem like different concerns, both are eugenic questions. In this class students will learn about the legacy of eugenics and its role in the development of genetics by analyzing science fiction works through the lens of disability studies. We'll explore the past to identify who has historically been considered ""fit"" and look to the future to consider what kinds of embodiments, and life experiences, society seems willing to let disappear.",202208,University Honors,,2,Leigha McReynolds,40,0,40,
HNUH228V,At What Cost? An Examination of the Societal and Ethical Impact of Modern Biological Research,"The results of modern biological research are pervasive - from cutting edge medical treatments, to debates about mandatory vaccination, to genetic engineering breakthroughs. This course will examine the social, ethical, and biological costs of research. The focus will be on the larger issues that surround the biology - questions of ethical research, the perception of science versus reality, the intersection of science and society, and even we may need to reconsider the meanings of ""self"" and ""human"". Students will reflect on the lessons learned to propose how research can proceed in a way that balances the demands of discovery with social justice and the ethical use of animals and the environment.",202208,University Honors,,1,Kenneth Frauwirth,20,0,20,
HNUH229P,Climate in Crisis: Strategy and Advocacy,"This theory and practice track examines theoretical frameworks for understanding climate change and concrete cases that shed light on the complexity of managing it. In this, the practical component of the Climate in Crisis track, we explore several domestic energy and climate policy case studies, examining the competing roles played by various interest groups that influence legislative and regulatory outcomes, with a focus on differing organizational advocacy strategies. Once we have mastered organizational advocacy strategies, students bring those tools to bear on the most recent US Federal policy mandates and legislation. In 229T, students will complement this work with a deep dive into the nature of public goods and climate change policy, among other crucial considerations.",202208,University Honors,,1,Tyson Slocum,20,0,20,
HNUH229T,Climate in Crisis: Politics and Ethics,"This theory and practice track examines theoretical frameworks for understanding climate change and concrete cases that shed light on the complexity of managing it. In this, the theoretical component of the Climate in Crisis track, we investigate the nature of global public goods and questions about how best to provide them in a situation of multiple actors (states, NGOs, local and indigenous communities); climate change policy and justice; and the intersection of climate change with concerns about biodiversity conservation, food security, migration, and local development. Learning from this broad range of material gives students the complex perspective they need to grapple with the climate crisis. In 229P, students will complement this work with hands-on engagement at the level of Federal policy and legislation.",202208,University Honors,,1,Thomas Hilde,10,10,0,
HNUH238B,Systemic Racism in Public Opinion and Policy Attitudes,"If we believe that racism is bad, why do we still support racist policies? No matter how hard we work to end it, the challenge of racism seems here to stay. Though attitudes toward racial segregation in schools have changed, schools are more racially isolated than ever. There is a disconnect in American public life between support for the idea of equality and resistance to policies aimed at addressing racism, and a deep divide over how to eliminate inequality. This course focuses on public opinion and how these attitudes inform public policy. Can we address systemic inequality through public engagement and by changing the national narrative with the support of evidence? Does change come from shifting views or shifting policies? Students will explore these issues through a case study on racial equity in the Honors College. By developing skills in evidence-based op-ed writing and survey-based experiments, students will add their voices to these pressing public debates of our time.",202208,University Honors,,1,Janelle Wong,60,6,54,
HNUH238U,Unequal Opportunity? Race and the Future of American Education,"America's schools are dynamic microcosms of society at large. They simultaneously reflect, reproduce, and shape what happens outside of the classroom, including the many ways that racism affects us all. The educational mechanisms that operate for the benefit of some and to the detriment of others are often hard to see, often because they are hidden in plain sight. For example, national tests are standardized. When racialized differences in test scores appear, they are called ""achievement gaps"" and the disparity is attributed to essential differences or cultural deficiency rather than inequitable access and opportunity. In this course students will learn methods to critically examine such commonplace notions as the achievement gap and to document their effects on society. They will also develop strategies for self-reflection that enable them to confront inequity in their own educational experience and work to create change.",202208,University Honors,,2,Robert Graham,40,33,7,
HNUH238V,Still Separate and Unequal? The Enduring Role of Segregation in American Life,"Racial segregation remains an enduring feature of American life today though many believe segregation is a relic of the past. Using an interdisciplinary approach that incorporates history, sociology, political science, and public policy, this course highlights the complex ways in which legacies of segregation continue to shape life in the US. We will identify how federal, state, and local governments endorsed systemic racism through policies that defined the racial geography and resources of racial groups in the US. Students will engage with policy experts to consider the promise and limits of policies that promote integration within communities and the connection between race, spatial location, and current political divisions.",202208,University Honors,,1,Alana Hackshaw,20,5,15,

HNUH248B,Setting the Table: The Challenges and Opportunities for Sustainable Agriculture,"What will the farm of the future look like? Our current food system is plagued with paradoxes. An estimated 41.2 million Americans are classified as food insecure, but we produce 4,000 calories per person per day. Between 2008 and 2012, 1.6 million acres of long-term grasslands were converted to crop production, yet more than 350,000 acres of farmland were lost to development annually. This course will investigate what determines the food we eat and how we can make changes today that will improve both food access and the environment for future generations. Students will learn agribusiness, as well as alternative food movements and regenerative agriculture. They will meet experts from the USDA and Maryland producers. By growing their own vegetables, tracking food consumption, and exploring family history linked to farming, students will leave the course as conscious consumers empowered to navigate food system reform.",202208,University Honors,,1,Stephanie Yarwood,55,0,55,
HNUH248U,The Loneliness Crisis: Origins and Solutions,"In 2017, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy deemed loneliness an ""epidemic."" Despite the rise of social media that is meant to foster connection, over 23% of adults report being lonely and social networks have been shrinking for decades. Like a viral epidemic, widespread loneliness has grave consequences. Loneliness shortens lifespans at a rate akin to smoking 15 cigarettes a day and predicts mortality risk better than poor diet or lack of exercise. This course will explore how loneliness became a crisis--exploring potential drivers of loneliness like social media, systemic racism, homophobia, and the rise of romantic love--and what we can do about it. It will end with students developing interventions to diminish loneliness and practicing skills to connect with one another.",202208,University Honors,,2,Marisa Franco,40,1,39,

HNUH258X,"Carnal Knowledge: Health, Data, and Power from Enlightenment to WebMD","""Carnal knowledge"" may sound provocative but, in a literal sense, it describes information derived from and about the human body. Consider a ship captain observing the tattoos of sailors to understand their origins, a surgeon examining a cadaver for signs of saintliness, or a natural philosopher ingesting an herb to determine its toxicity. These are instances of carnal knowledge. Historically, such intimate acts turned the body into a site of data collection and a powerful source of information. Both by choice and by force, the instrumentalization of the human body was used to solve scientific problems as well as to justify hierarchies of race and sex. Through a deep engagement with this material, students will connect topics such as the transatlantic slave trade to cell lines as they uncover the embodied relationship between information and power that still shapes our world today.",202208,University Honors,,2,Zachary Dorner,40,1,39,
HNUH259P,Drawn to D.C.: Sketching the City,"Did you draw as a child? Are you a doodler? These pastimes are more than a distraction and amusement. Sketching is a way of thinking about your environment and understanding how you inhabit space. This course invites students to experience Washington, D.C. like an architect: with their eyes and their hands. We will study the work of architects and urban designers; visit landmarks in and around D.C. and the campus; and sketch indoors and outdoors. With D.C. as our laboratory, we will draw to understand the components that make the city a city, and explore tactile meanings of buildings and public spaces. Techniques presented in the course will range from the technical to the artistic, from field measuring and freehand sketching to creating 2D and 3D architectural drawings and presenting them. No drawing experience required! This course is self-contained but paired with HNUH259T in the Drawn to D.C. track, which explores the spaces we create and inhabit, and how they inhabit us.",202208,University Honors,,1,Michael Abrams,10,10,0,
HNUH268A,Arbitrating our Bodily Rights: What it Means to Consent,"Both American law and conventional morality support the view that human beings have bodily rights - ones we can waive by giving another person our consent to do what would otherwise be a rights violation. Yet, debate about the sovereignty of an individual's body and the potential rights of others--including the state--over our bodies lies at the core of some of the most contentious issues facing us as a society. This class will investigate the thorny debates that pertain to consent in sexual relations, medicine and research, and bodily markets. What types threats, offers, or cognitive incapacities undermine true consent? How do we evaluate the moral or legal significance of bodily rights when they come into tension with the government's interest? After evaluating arguments, exploring distinctions, and using philosophical tools to arrive at reasoned conclusions about consent, students will learn to apply these conceptual tools to cases from fiction and current events.",202208,University Honors,,3,Hallie Liberto,45,2,43,

HNUH278X,A Way with Words: Order and Knowledge in Enlightenment Europe,"""Without language, things cannot well be expressed or published to the World,"" wrote Edward Phillips in The New World of English Words (1658). In this course, we will interrogate the power of words to communicate and classify, to impose meaning and order in the historical moment that brought about many of our modern institutions and ways of thinking: the European Enlightenment. From the binomial taxonomies with which Linnaeus ordered ""chaos and confusion"" to the racist taxonomies deployed to reinforce inequities, we will survey how language facilitated the consolidation of European power at home and abroad. We will further develop the visual literacy to decode how images convey knowledge. Looking back to the period that gave shape to many modern languages, institutions, and divisions of knowledge, we will be poised to face today's crises.",202208,University Honors,,2,Lauren Cannady,40,0,40,
HNUH288A,"Welcome to the Party: Race, Nightlife, and Identity in America","How does play shape our humanity and national identity? We often define people by the work that they do, whereas we tend to think of leisure and after work playfulness as a release from that identity. This course takes up a particular form of play--nightlife--to reckon with how it shapes what it means to be human and how it impacts nationhood, particularly around matters of race and oppression. Spanning from slavery to the present, this course examines how nightlife has been used to deny black people's humanity and been a vital site of playfulness, manifest as joy, resistance, self-making, and aesthetic innovation. Using performance studies to make sense of the world, our explorations will range from cakewalk dance competitions on plantations to queer night clubs. Once students better understand how nightlife is vital to the making and the unmaking of black people's humanity, they will grapple with play as a meaning-maker in their own lives and in our democracy.",202208,University Honors,,1,Julius Fleming,30,30,0,

In the digital world designed by and for human beings, all sorts of actors imitate people, while people are objectified through surveillance and data mining. Despite a frequent distinction between the internet and 'IRL,' physical bodies are wrapped up in every aspect of existence online: from the factory workers who build our technology to the postures and gestures those devices require us to adopt. Exploring this range of bodily phenomena, this course considers what constitutes a ""human body"" online and how digitality and connectivity inform our understanding of personhood. From RPGs and dance challenges to AI and visceral responses to internet content, students will analyze the complex relationships between the technological and the embodied, the social and the political, the past and the future.",202208,University Honors,,2,Alexandra Harlig,40,0,40,
HNUH288Z,Non-Human Animals in Human Society,"As humans, we share our lives with other animals in diverse and conflicting ways. Non-human animals can be consumed as food, used for scientific research, and treasured as companions. They are commercialized, worshipped, and stereotyped. Our complex relationships with other animals emerge from and fuel debates about what makes ""us"" different from ""them."" In this course, we will ask (and attempt to answer) questions such as: What roles do we open to (or force on) non-human animals in American culture and why? Who makes these decisions and what is their effect on animal life? We will explore the evolution of modern human-animal relationships to contextualize major social and scientific debates that have arisen in the last century, including what it means to be human in this context, and why they matter.",202208,University Honors,,1,Halli Weiner,20,6,14,

What does ""User Experience"" mean? It was a term coined by cognitive psychologist and designer Don Norman in the 1990s on the cusp of the new digital era; however, the field in practice has existed long before that. Unfortunately, due to its over use and misuse, the pure concept of UX has become lost in the weeds and details of all of its components and methods. In this course, we will take a deep look at the true meaning of UX as simply a user's experience and what that means for you as both a designer and a user. You will learn about core UX principles and methodologies from both an academic and practical standpoint and be challenged to apply what you learn in classroom workshops and assignments. Finally, you will be asked to think both inside and outside the bounds of technology to find innovative solutions to real world design problems.

Not only health care providers are relying on Health Technologies to improve patient care, people are increasingly using health devices and apps in their everyday life. Individuals have started using new technologies to collect data, increase awareness, and reflect on and change their behaviors. They also use various tools for curiosity and fun. This course will provide an overview of this exciting field and examine how social and behavioral theories can be applied to create effective health applications.It is difficult to create health technologies that can successfully be integrated into people's daily life due to many obstacles in individuals' data collection, integration, self-reflection, and sharing practices. Understanding these challenges is an important part of designing Health Technologies. Therefore, this course will cover HCI and design thinking methods that you can leverage in understanding the adoption of Health Technologies.

In multi-species contexts, we now have the tools to understand the importance of interspecific gene flow in adaptation, determine the role of genetic diversity in community composition, and characterize the diversity and function of cryptic organisms, such as microbes, in communities and ecosystems. This course will cover the major research topics in ecological genomics, considering individual, population, interspecific, and community and ecosystem hierarchical levels. The course will comprise lectures, student-led discussions of primary literature exemplifying applications of genomics to contemporary environmental problems, and hands-on experience manipulating and analyzing real genomic data sets with the latest bioinformatic tools in the UNIX/Linux and R environments.",202208,Marine-Estuarine-Environmental Sciences,,1,Louis Plough; Clara Fuchsman; Rodney Richardson,20,10,10,

Although the United States has long been praised for its inclusiveness vis-a-vis citizenship - including a policy of jus soli, or birthright citizenship - a closer look reveals a difficult history involving the categorical exclusion of many groups from American citizenship. In this seminar, we will examine this history, focusing particularly on Black and Native Americans and immigrants, and drawing upon legal cases, historical texts, and personal narratives detailing the lived experiences of those seeking American citizenship. We will trace this history to the present and explore the current process and requirements for becoming an American citizen. In addition to the listed instructor, this course will also offer an opportunity for students to engage with a range of different actors in the citizenship and naturalization space through guest lectures and discussions from immigration clinical legal students from the Maryland Carey School of Law, academics, law professors, leading legal practitioners, and other experts.",202208,MPower Undergraduate Law Programs,,1,Grace Benton,18,2,16,

This course aims to explore some aspects of the diverse and increasingly complex body of laws, policies, and attempted solutions related to housing and land in a largely unequal world and society. How has private land ownership changed societies in the modern era? What is the role of the state in addressing housing shortages and injustices related to land and housing? What does a fundamental human right to housing look like in the real world?

Markets are pervasive throughout our lives, but we rarely think about them from an ethical perspective. This course examines questions at the intersection of ethics and markets.

Epistemology is the philosophical study of knowledge and rational belief. Bayesian epistemology frames this study by centering not on full beliefs (like my belief that there is no chocolate on the moon) but instead on graded belief. This is for example what happens when we say that we are 80% confident that a certain party will win an election. Among the topics to be covered in the class are: the connection between degrees of belief and the mathematical theory of probability; the principles governing whether degrees of belief are rational; the principles whether agents respond appropriately to evidence; the role of degrees of belief in practical decision making. The approach in the class will be to present these topics without presupposing prior competence in epistemology.",202208,Philosophy,,1,Fabrizio Cariani,24,10,14,

Philosophy and Law deal with many of the same concepts but from different perspectives. This class explores ways in which the two fields interact, demonstrating how the use of philosophical tools can enhance understanding of many areas of law, from free speech, the rules of evidence, and criminal law to contracts, antitrust, and corporations. It will expose students to concrete legal issues that lawyers deal with on a day-to-day basis. At the same time, this cross-disciplinary class, which should not be confused with philosophy of law, will deepen the student's knowledge of critical ideas in epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of language, and other philosophical subjects. Previous exposure to basic philosophical concepts would be helpful, though not essential.",202208,Philosophy,,1,Kenneth Glazer,25,4,21,

We begin by examining capitalism and socialism as they developed historically, by looking primarily at the work of Adam Smith and Karl Marx. Then, we turn our attention to one of the most important debates in 20th century economics: to what extent rational economic calculation is possible in a socialist commonwealth. After this we turn our attention to how capitalist and socialist modes of production functioned in practice. We end by turning our attention to the ethics of capitalism and socialism: which mode of economic production is most just?",202208,"Philosophy, Politics, and Economics",,1,Aylon Manor,30,0,30,

PHPE408D,"Advanced Topics in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics; Theories of Democracy","Cross-listed with PHIL408D. Credit only granted for PHPE408D or PHIL408D.

Many think that democracy is the only acceptable form of government, but it is hard to articulate why. This course will look at normative arguments in defense of democracy. It will also look at criticisms of these arguments, along with normative arguments in favor of non-democratic forms of government. The course will also look at theoretical and empirical work concerning how democracies actually function in the real world (e.g., the median voter theorem, the Hong-Page theorem, McKelvey Schofield chaos theorem, etc.), and ask how this theoretical and empirical work should inform our normative arguments for democracy.",202208,"Philosophy, Politics, and Economics",,1,Aylon Manor,30,5,25,
PHPE408E,"Advanced Topics in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics; The Ethics of Markets","Cross-listed with PHIL408E. Credit only granted for PHPE408E or PHIL408E.

Markets are pervasive throughout our lives, but we rarely think about them from an ethical perspective. This course examines questions at the intersection of ethics and markets. It asks questions like: what is the extent of permissible market exchange? What sorts of things can be bought and sold on the market? Do markets corrupt our morals? Do markets presuppose certain morals? Does trade between nations lead to tolerance? What are the social responsibilities of business?",202208,"Philosophy, Politics, and Economics",,1,Antong Liu,30,4,26,

PHPE408K,"Advanced Topics in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics; Philosophy and Law","Cross-listed with PHIL438L. Credit only granted for PHIL438L or PHPE408K.

Philosophy and Law deal with many of the same concepts but from different perspectives. This class explores ways in which the two fields interact, demonstrating how the use of philosophical tools can enhance understanding of many areas of law, from free speech, the rules of evidence, and criminal law to contracts, antitrust, and corporations. It will expose students to concrete legal issues that lawyers deal with on a day-to-day basis. At the same time, this cross-disciplinary class, which should not be confused with philosophy of law, will deepen the student's knowledge of critical ideas in epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of language, and other philosophical subjects. Previous exposure to basic philosophical concepts would be helpful, though not essential.",202208,"Philosophy, Politics, and Economics",,1,Kenneth Glazer,25,4,21,
PHPE408X,"Advanced Topics in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics; Bayesian Epistemology","Cross-listed with PHIL418X. Credit only granted for PHIL418X or PHPE408X.

Epistemology is the philosophical study of knowledge and rational belief. Bayesian epistemology frames this study by centering not on full beliefs (like my belief that there is no chocolate on the moon) but instead on graded belief. This is for example what happens when we say that we are 80% confident that a certain party will win an election. Among the topics to be covered in the class are: the connection between degrees of belief and the mathematical theory of probability; the principles governing whether degrees of belief are rational; the principles whether agents respond appropriately to evidence; the role of degrees of belief in practical decision making. The approach in the class will be to present these topics without presupposing prior competence in epistemology.",202208,"Philosophy, Politics, and Economics",,1,Fabrizio Cariani,24,10,14,

The changing definitions of race in America have been shaped by political institutions for centuries. Since the founding, American institutions have been marked by racial inequality.

Often, Prince George's County will be the launching point for broader discussions and analyses pertaining to relationships between racial and ethnic groups in this community. We will also pay particular attention to the causes of contemporary racial mobilization and to its consequences. In particular, we will discuss how Prince George's County is affected by former executives as well as the current governor and president and the remnants of the racially charged nature of the previous presidential administration.",202208,Public Policy,,1,Niambi Carter,20,17,3,

Fruit and vegetable crops harboring enteric pathogens such as Salmonella enterica, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and Cyclospora cause thousands of foodborne illnesses and millions of dollars in financial losses a year. Enteric bacteria, viruses and parasites use various strategies to persist in the plant niche to pose a food safety risk to consumers. This course will discuss these microbial strategies, and how enteric bacteria colonize and internalize in plants. We will also examine plant recognition of bacteria and the ensuing bacterial response in enterobacterial-plant interactions.

A comprehensive overview of the field of behavioral endocrinology, the study of the relationship between hormones and behavior, from a psychobiological perspective. Examine the major mammalian endocrine systems, how hormones influence sex determination, how hormones underlie sex differences in brain structure and function, the role of hormones in parental and social behaviors, mood disorders, homeostasis, cognition, and stress. Both normal and abnormal hormonal pathologies will be discussed. Due to the physiological and experimental perspectives, much of the phenomenology will be based on research in species other than humans.

The construct of ""neighborhood"" is explored throughout the course as both a social organizing principle and as an economic marketplace. Neighborhoods are considered throughout the historical forces that have shaped them, reaching back to the original formation of ethnic and racial ghettos and moving forward through urban renewal and modern-day gentrification. The changing forms of the real estate projects that have sustained these neighborhoods over time are evaluated . As changes further continued in neighborhoods and altered perceived demands for housing and services, the factors that changed the viability of real estate projects are closely investigated. The course also considers the government and policy landscapes that have helped shape neighborhood form and the real estate types found there. These policies are understood through review of actual case examples.",202208,Real Estate Development,,1,Instructor: TBA,15,15,0,

The feminist song ""El violador eres tu"" (The Rapist is You) - originally performed by the collective ""Las Tesis"" in Valparaiso, Chile - has become a global hymn to protest violence against women. The performance was based on the work of anthropologist Rita Segato, whose studies have exposed power structures and the systematic violations of womens rights. By reading contemporary women writers, and by working on contemporary feminist social movements, this course will explore what Segato has defined as ""the war against women"". Thus, this seminar will explore how feminist subversion of naturalized power relationships have become a social force that is reshaping Latin American culture in the last decades. Particularly, we will explore how contemporary cultural artifacts contest value systems while rejecting hierarchies and norms.",202208,Spanish,,1,Laura Demaria,25,19,6,

Relevant Hispanic Caribbean literary, musical and historical texts display their images in a culinary space. Images of food, but more specifically, of sabor (flavor, taste: a knowledge or sense coming from flavor) work as metaphors, and as landscapes or seascapes, for the configuration of a singular aesthetic, sensible and political experience. Specifically, the course will discuss the corporeal and sensorial realities excited by this culinary imaginary. Issues of identity, race, gender, politics, and literary representation will be discussed, problematized and questioned. Furthermore, during this class we will put in motion our own critical skills while reading or listening to texts or cultural objects produced in a Hispanic Caribbean society. Students will be expected to participate actively in class, give an oral presentation, write short essays and a final research paper, and complete miscellaneous assignments.",202208,Spanish,,1,Juan Carlos Quintero-Herencia,25,11,14,

Of specialconsideration is the way in which this period represented for many writers and artists in Mexico an intense period of political and aesthetic possibility, invention, and renovation. In part, the course will focus on how the apparent promise of the Revolution and the flourishing of Mexican culture drew many figures from around the world, including, to name a few, Edward Weston, Tina Modotti, Andre Breton, Sergei Eisenstein, and Mariana Yampolsky. Also significant are patrons of the arts with cosmopolitan and transnational biographies and educational training, such as Antonieta Rivas Mercado, Anita Brenner, and Frances Toor, who were essential for supporting and disseminating the work of figures such as Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo, and writers movements like Los Contemporaneos.",202208,Spanish,,1,Ryan Long,10,4,6,

In recent decades, immigration from Latin America, the Caribbean, and Spain, and Latinx migrations across the United States have vastly diversified, translocalized, and complicated Latinx discourses, making the X the sign of the times.
