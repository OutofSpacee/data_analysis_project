AASP230,Social (In)Justice and African-American Health and Well-Being,"African Americans suffer worse outcomes than non-Hispanic whites on nearly every health measure and outcomes that link to overall well-being like depressive symptoms or homicides. Health disparities are experienced by other underrepresented minority groups, but because of the unique historic and current experiences of African Americans, the determinants and solutions to African American health disparities are unique. The premise of this course is that African American health disparities are due to social injustices perpetuated on the institutional level that have permeated the lived experiences of African Americans leading to racial disparities in health and well-being. As such, the solutions on the both policy, and community, level must have a social justice approach.",202308,African American Studies,,1,Cecily Hardaway,6,5,1,

Anticolonial work by Ousmane Sembene and Sarah Maldoror, memory work by Haile Gerima and Julie Dash, and vernacular filmmaking by Charles Burnett, Spike Lee, Perry Henzell, Melvin Van Peebles, and others will introduce us to the varied concerns of Black filmmakers in moments of independence struggle and post-emancipation identity formation. While eclectic in selection, our examination of these films will be oriented around a pair of questions. What is antiblackness and how does cinema encounter, contemplate, and critique it? How do different geographies and historical experiences shift cultural and political concerns, as well as the methods of cinema along with those differing concerns? Such questions will allow us to see how questions of antiblackness and Black life operate in the between and overlapping spaces of colonial experience, ghettoization, and sites of resistance, rebellion, and radicalism.",202308,African American Studies,,1,John Drabinski,25,2,23,0

The position of women within avant-garde movements was complex as they fought for professional advancement while often being barred from mainstream art academies and facing limited opportunities. Nevertheless, many women carved out spaces of representation and their work critically adds to our understanding of avant-garde movements.

A comprehensive overview of the field of behavioral endocrinology, the study of the relationship between hormones and behavior, from a psychobiological perspective. Examine the major mammalian endocrine systems, how hormones influence sex determination, how hormones underlie sex differences in brain structure and function, the role of hormones in parental and social behaviors, mood disorders, homeostasis, cognition, and stress. Both normal and abnormal hormonal pathologies will be discussed. Due to the physiological and experimental perspectives, much of the phenomenology will be based on research in species other than humans.

Using an intersectional lens, we criticallyengage biographical, autobiographical, and historical works that give voice to the political experiences of individual women of color. We broaden the notion of ""politics"" to be inclusive of women of color that are close confidants of male political figures (first ladies,wives, and ""mistresses""), revolutionaries, activists, as well as those that serve in formal political positions (elected officials, politicians, and justices). Finally, we grapple with the impact of public policy on the lives of women of color.",202308,Government and Politics,,1,Chryl Laird,30,0,30,0

Moreover, they may not encourage experimentation, innovation, and business success. Not surprisingly then, companies are redefining what the future of work should look like.

Sacred texts like the Hebrew bible challenge human understanding the voice of the divine, they demand our constant study, interpretation and reinterpretation. Jewish scholars have been engaged in this process, known as exegesis, for many centuries, and have used many different methods to make the Bible give up its mysteries. In this course we will use the method of close reading to watch as rabbis struggled with, and argued over, biblical passages in order to construct Jewish law and Jewish rationalist and mystical theologies. We will examine issues ranging from vegetarianism to messianism, gender to eros, the purpose of life, the holiness of Jerusalem to the legitimacy of Halacha. The course is based on close text study of the biblical text and rabbinic commentaries in Hebrew.",202308,Hebrew,,1,Bernard Cooperman,6,6,0,0

Most people in all societies learn and use their native language or languages with apparent ease - but don't be fooled: languages are highly complex, and speaking and understanding language requires some amazing feats of mental acrobatics. Thus there are many opportunities for difficulties with language, which is the focus of our field. Understanding difficulties with speech, language, and hearing require first understanding how processing works when language is successful - the psychological (behavioral) and neurobiological (brain) factors that enable people to learn and use language despite its intricacies, the structure and properties of language itself, and how knowledge of language is acquired, represented, and processed in the mind and brain.",202308,Hearing and Speech Sciences,,1,Fathima Zuhurudeen,50,43,7,0

HNUH218B,Frederick Douglass's America,"What does it mean to be free in the United States? The concept of freedom was embedded in the nation's political culture in the Declaration of Independence, and it has remained a cherished and contested ideal. We can interrogate this concept through the life and times of Frederick Douglass (1818-1895), who dreamed eloquently of freedom, thought carefully about its limits, and worked ardently to build a firmer freedom for a broader population. With Douglass as our guide, we will examine the survival of slavery in a nation built on freedom, images of the expanding United States as a land of opportunity, and the complex meanings and tremendous costs of freedom struggles during the nineteenth century. This history will push you to think critically about the contested concepts that shape our lives, and to consider the values and the perils of a society that positions freedom as its highest ideal.",202308,University Honors,,3,Christopher Bonner,60,18,42,0
HNUH218J,The Free Internet,"Free speech, free porn, free shipping... What does it mean for something to be 'free' online and how does our participation in the internet liberate or constrain our identities, bodies, and relation with others? In this class we'll talk about the economics, politics, and culture of the internet to assess how values and value are made and circulated within its technologies. We'll focus on the many ways the term 'free' operates in this context, notably, around the ability to create, distribute, and access information. Centered on the US with a comparative eye on the global internet ecosystem, this seminar asks: Where do the rights and responsibilities for a ""free internet"" come from, and to whom do they apply? What identities and bodies are at risk or rewarded in these systems? What are the choices individuals, platforms, and governments must make to determine the future of the internet and the freedom of the people who build and use it?",202308,University Honors,,2,Alexandra Harlig,40,15,25,0
HNUH218U,Finding Feminist Freedom,"""I'm the one that'll make you pay."" So goes one verse of what has become a Latin American feminist hymn, ""Cancion sin miedo"" (""Fearless Song,"" by Vivir Quintana). Transnationally, feminists today--particularly in the Global South--are on fire: militant, unafraid, angry, and, above all, driven by a desire to build a world where the promise of freedom for all is finally fulfilled. But what is freedom? Is freedom an abstract concept or a lived experience? Is it individual or collective? What is the meaning of 'feminist freedom'? These questions will be gauged by discussing, analyzing, and interpreting texts in feminist theory; decolonial and transnational feminist approaches; and feminist film, documentary, performance, and protest. At the end of the course, you will have learned that there is not one feminism, but many, become familiar with feminist theory and practice, and be equipped to live your own version of a feminist life.",202308,University Honors,,2,Veronica Zebadua-Yanez,20,0,20,0
HNUH218V,Black Bodies and Green Spaces: From 1619 to Today,"From the antebellum plantation slave, who used uncultivated land as a place of deliverance, healing and route to freedom, to the Central Park bird watcher, whose green space presence was perceived as a threat to White physical safety, black bodies have a vexed relationship to green space. This course critically examines how systemic racism has shaped the experience, connection, and relationship to nature among Black Americans. Students will conduct in-depth analysis, critical thinking, and discussion on topics ranging from slavery and nature; The Great Migration; and Jim Crow, segregation, and parks; to green space inequity and ""Moving While Black"" (Treyvon to Ahmaud). While some environments (built, natural, virtual) within the United States have represented the essence of anti-Black racism and indignity, this course will further explore how many Black Americans still regarded nature as a space of freedom, humanity, and spirituality.",202308,University Honors,,1,Jennifer Roberts,20,15,5,0
HNUH219T,Transform Maryland: Consulting Practicum,"In this experiential learning opportunity, a team of students undertakes a real-world practicum to develop consulting skills and improve an operational process at the University of Maryland. A new project is selected each semester and the course culminates in a presentation to key members of the UMD leadership team. Through concepts drawn from multiple disciplines, students learn and apply an analytical, systems approach to problem solving. Working with oversight from experts in the industry, students partner with university officials to understand and map a business process that affects students, identify opportunities for process innovation, and apply user-centered design to develop a persuasive narrative to recommend solutions and leverage the potential for technology to streamline the process. This practicum prepares students to consult for real-world change, while practicing competencies they will use in their professional internship experience the following semester (HNUH219P).",202308,University Honors,,1,Joseph Drasin; Megan MacKenzie; Jeffrey Hollingsworth,10,6,4,0
HNUH228B,Redesigning Life: Prospects and Consequences,"What is at stake for our world as humans seek to redesign biological organisms? Biotechnology advances are enabling us to read, edit and write genomes, including our own. This revolution has been fueled by the quest to understand and cure disease. Yet, these innovations have far-reaching consequences beyond medicine and will reshape our world in ways we can only imagine - or fear. The course will challenge students to confront the risks and rewards for them, their family, their community, and their future, as biotechnology moves out of specialized laboratories and into homes. A demystifying, low-tech approach will introduce them to contemporary genome redesign, clarifying the current limitations and future goals of the field. Students will debate whether redesigning plants and animals will enhance or inhibit momentum in human genome engineering, and formulate their own arguments about who should be able to use these tools and where, who decides, and how much society is willing to risk.",202308,University Honors,,1,Edward Eisenstein,60,0,60,0
HNUH228U,A Life Worth Living: The Legacy of Eugenics in Genetics,"Should parents be able to choose their child's eye color? Or alter their child's genome to eliminate a hereditary disability? While these might seem like different concerns, both are eugenic questions. In this class students will learn about the legacy of eugenics and its role in the development of genetics by analyzing science fiction works through the lens of disability studies. We'll explore the past to identify who has historically been considered ""fit"" and look to the future to consider what kinds of embodiments, and life experiences, society seems willing to let disappear.",202308,University Honors,,2,Leigha McReynolds,40,0,40,0
HNUH228V,At What Cost? An Examination of the Societal and Ethical Impact of Modern Biological Research,"The results of modern biological research are pervasive - from cutting edge medical treatments, to debates about mandatory vaccination, to genetic engineering breakthroughs. This course will examine the social, ethical, and biological costs of research. The focus will be on the larger issues that surround the biology - questions of ethical research, the perception of science versus reality, the intersection of science and society, and even we may need to reconsider the meanings of ""self"" and ""human"". Students will reflect on the lessons learned to propose how research can proceed in a way that balances the demands of discovery with social justice and the ethical use of animals and the environment.",202308,University Honors,,1,Kenneth Frauwirth,20,0,20,0
HNUH229T,Climate in Crisis: Socio-Environmental Sustainability,"What does it mean to achieve sustainability and how does use of a socio-environmental lens help move the world in that direction? In this, the theory component of the Climate in Crisis track, students will develop an understanding of socio-environmental systems, what they have in common with other complex adaptive systems and the approaches used to study them. With a focus on why a socio-environmental systems approach can help illuminate the environmental, socio-cultural, economic, and intersectional dimensions of sustainability, we will explore what different disciplines bring to this complex topic and use qualitative and quantitative approaches to grapple with problems of sustainability. How do we work with stakeholders to identify the vulnerable, the equitable paths forward, and the trade-offs? Who are the winners and losers of policy decisions? In HNUH229P, students will complement the work of this course with hands-on engagement at the level of Federal policy and legislation.",202308,University Honors,,1,Margaret Palmer,20,1,19,0
HNUH238B,Systemic Racism in Public Opinion and Policy Attitudes,"If we believe that racism is bad, why do we still support racist policies? No matter how hard we work to end it, the challenge of racism seems here to stay. Though attitudes toward racial segregation in schools have changed, schools are more racially isolated than ever. There is a disconnect in American public life between support for the idea of equality and resistance to policies aimed at addressing racism, and a deep divide over how to eliminate inequality. This course focuses on public opinion and how these attitudes inform public policy. Can we address systemic inequality through public engagement and by changing the national narrative with the support of evidence? Does change come from shifting views or shifting policies? Students will explore these issues through a case study on racial equity in the Honors College. By developing skills in evidence-based op-ed writing and survey-based experiments, students will add their voices to these pressing public debates of our time.",202308,University Honors,,1,Janelle Wong,60,2,58,0
HNUH238U,Unequal Opportunity? Race and the Future of American Education,"America's schools are dynamic microcosms of society at large. They simultaneously reflect, reproduce, and shape what happens outside of the classroom, including the many ways that racism affects us all. The educational mechanisms that operate for the benefit of some and to the detriment of others are often hard to see, often because they are hidden in plain sight. For example, national tests are standardized. When racialized differences in test scores appear, they are called ""achievement gaps"" and the disparity is attributed to essential differences or cultural deficiency rather than inequitable access and opportunity. In this course students will learn methods to critically examine such commonplace notions as the achievement gap and to document their effects on society. They will also develop strategies for self-reflection that enable them to confront inequity in their own educational experience and work to create change.",202308,University Honors,,2,Robert Graham,40,13,27,0
HNUH238V,Still Separate and Unequal? The Enduring Role of Segregation in American Life,"Racial segregation remains an enduring feature of American life today though many believe segregation is a relic of the past. Using an interdisciplinary approach that incorporates history, sociology, political science, and public policy, this course highlights the complex ways in which legacies of segregation continue to shape life in the US. We will identify how federal, state, and local governments endorsed systemic racism through policies that defined the racial geography and resources of racial groups in the US. Students will engage with policy experts to consider the promise and limits of policies that promote integration within communities and the connection between race, spatial location, and current political divisions.",202308,University Honors,,1,Alana Hackshaw,20,0,20,0

HNUH239T,Geopolitics of Finance: Innovation & Cross-Cultural Globalization,"Introduces students to the creative possibilities of the global economy: cross-cultural innovation, collaborative design-driven solutions, and enduring innovation with global purchase. Students will encounter innovations in global business that are transforming the future through an embrace of diverse cultural perspectives. Working with interactive idealized design, out-of-the-box-thinking, and strategic exploration tools, students will explore and experience relevant design to new and cross-cultural value creation. Through rapid prototyping, immersive reflections, and innovative design activities, students will experience how to translate insight into action, and action into tangible results. The evolutionary application of frameworks in this course culminates in a capstone project. This course is self-contained but paired with HNUH239P in the Geopolitics of Finance track, which explores how globalization has brought about fundamental changes to our daily lives by making the world more interdependent.",202308,University Honors,,1,Gerald Suarez,20,1,19,0
HNUH248B,Setting the Table: The Challenges and Opportunities for Sustainable Agriculture,"What will the farm of the future look like? Our current food system is plagued with paradoxes. An estimated 41.2 million Americans are classified as food insecure, but we produce 4,000 calories per person per day. Between 2008 and 2012, 1.6 million acres of long-term grasslands were converted to crop production, yet more than 350,000 acres of farmland were lost to development annually. This course will investigate what determines the food we eat and how we can make changes today that will improve both food access and the environment for future generations. Students will learn agribusiness, as well as alternative food movements and regenerative agriculture. They will meet experts from the USDA and Maryland producers. By growing their own vegetables, tracking food consumption, and exploring family history linked to farming, students will leave the course as conscious consumers empowered to navigate food system reform.",202308,University Honors,,1,Stephanie Yarwood,55,0,55,0
HNUH248U,The Loneliness Crisis: Origins and Solutions,"In 2017, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy deemed loneliness an ""epidemic."" Despite the rise of social media that is meant to foster connection, over 23% of adults report being lonely and social networks have been shrinking for decades. Like a viral epidemic, widespread loneliness has grave consequences. Loneliness shortens lifespans at a rate akin to smoking 15 cigarettes a day and predicts mortality risk better than poor diet or lack of exercise. This course will explore how loneliness became a crisis--exploring potential drivers of loneliness like social media, systemic racism, homophobia, and the rise of romantic love--and what we can do about it. It will end with students developing interventions to diminish loneliness and practicing skills to connect with one another.",202308,University Honors,,2,Marisa Franco,40,0,40,0

HNUH258B,The Ecology of Childhood Poverty,"How does poverty shape the relationship between humans and their environment? It may seem obvious that being poor in childhood has enduring effects on development. What is less obvious is how experiencing poverty in childhood shapes relationships between children and their surroundings, including family interactions, peer relationships, adult dynamics, and the health of the community. Less clear still is the extent to which positive interactions with caretakers and social supports can protect children from potential harm as they grow up. This course focuses on the complexity of poverty as a social force and community concern. Students will investigate the nature of poverty through an interdisciplinary lens that includes social theory, developmental psychology, and empirical studies. After analyzing various approaches to the study of child poverty, students will be in a position to use research on parenting and poverty to evaluate public policy and social programs in their own backyard.",202308,University Honors,,1,Natasha Cabrera,60,6,54,0
HNUH258U,The Basis of Behavior: Evolution and the Origin of Actions,"Why do some monkeys spend time grooming each other in large groups, while others lose their minds with rage if another monkey comes too close? Complex organisms exhibit behaviors that both fascinate and confound, and the way an animal behaves dictates how it interacts with its environment, with profound consequences. Individual behaviors can have dramatic effects on individual fitness, an individual's groupmates, and even the evolution of species. This leads to a fundamental question in behavioral evolution: why do animals do the things they do? The answer lies in the interaction between individual experiences and eons of natural selection. In this seminar, students investigate what organisms were, what they have become, and why. With a focus on the transitions in behavior that caused single cells to evolve over time into complex societies, students will apply evolutionary principles to individual development and explore how and why individuals choose certain behaviors over others.",202308,University Honors,,2,Riva Riley,40,1,39,0

HNUH268B,Global Heritage,"What traction does the past have in society today? This course explores globally how the past gains traction in society today and becomes remade in the present. That inquiry will be guided by the idea of heritage, as it mobilizes the past within a broad spectrum of social, political, economic, and environmental issues. We will examine western relationships to the past as intimately tied to property and the drive to plunder, collect, and catalogue. Increasingly, conceptions of heritage include landscapes, as well as intangibles such as music, dance, and folklore. This broad definition honors the diversity of present-day relations to the past, even as it strains heritage management models that are organized around definitions and regulations, and bear the weight of historical injustice. Close examination of heritage at work within global crisis and struggle prompts questions on who owns the past, and who owns up to it. What do we owe the past, and will we be good ancestors to the future?",202308,University Honors,,3,Kathryn Lafrenz Samuels,60,41,19,0
HNUH268U,"Power, Politics, and the Past: Local Communities and Cultural Heritage","The politics of the past surround us. An online memorial to the struggle against the Dakota Pipeline, the call to commemorate Indigeneity instead of Columbus, monuments to the Confederacy torn down... How do diverse communities claim--or reject--particular places, practices, and ideas as their shared heritage, and why? In this course, we will explore these questions with reference to Indigenous communities in global context, with a particular focus on Mexico. Students will engage with theoretical approaches and contemporary case studies to analyze the politics and ethics surrounding the use of the past in diverse Indigenous presents. Visits to DC's museums and archives will help students practice theorizing real-world materials. Students will leave the course with the analytical tools necessary to understand cultural heritage and advocate for Indigenous perspectives on the past. A typical day in this course will involve reading an article-length work and participating in student-led discussion.",202308,University Honors,,2,Samuel Holley-Kline,40,25,15,0
HNUH268W,"Where the Waters Blend: Contemporary Indigenous Perspectives on History, Traditions, and Modern Issues","In this unique cultural and personal learning experience, students will explore the history, traditions, and contemporary issues faced by Maryland's Indigenous people. The experiential work of the course asks students to consider how the past matters, particularly when it is embodied in the land they live on, and their present obligations to it. On-campus and place-based learning, focused on the precolonial and colonial histories of Maryland's Indigenous people, and their contemporary issues create opportunities for students to reflect upon and interrogate their understanding of Maryland's past, present, and future. Students will emerge from this course with a greater understanding of the Maryland's Indigenous people and an increased capacity to challenge colonial and postcolonial paradigms that marginalize the Indigenous people in our region, nation, and across the globe.",202308,University Honors,,1,Angela Stoltz,20,13,7,0

HNUH278B,Democratic Habits,"How do ordinary citizens power democracy? At the age of 18, every American citizen is endowed with the right to vote, but what if democracy demands more than voting? With democratic processes seemingly in peril all around us, what can and should ordinary citizens do to safeguard democracy? Looking beyond the basic right to vote, this class will instead explore the complex ecosystem of citizenship practices necessary for collective self-governance. Turning to both philosophy and history, the course material addresses the power and peril of such civic habits as mutual aid, economic participation, tolerance, attention, organizing, protest, and more. We consider what resources these habits require, what virtues they inspire, and what happens when they conflict with each other. Students in this course will acquire the tools to develop and act on their own answer to the pressing question of what it will take to save democracy.",202308,University Honors,,1,Kristjana Maddux,60,1,59,0
HNUH278U,"Indigenous Knowledge, Supernatural Remedy, and Collective Action: Lessons from Agrarian Societies","How were human communities sustained before the rise of capitalism, individualism, and secularism? Where can we look to imagine a world in which modern science, polity, and ethics are not the defining system of civil social? Through an exploration of stories from late medieval Europe, China, Southeast Asia, and other regional communities, with a particular focus on the East, this course aims at de-orientalizing the narratives of the Western world by recovering the collective practices of the global past and present. Interrogating the idea that human history has been a linear process of industrialization and secularization, this course encourages students to reflect on the limits and problems of modernization, and learn from cultures whose practices were displaced or silenced by colonial knowledge production. Students will be empowered to consider, and even envision, alternative versions of modernity and the future of our world.",202308,University Honors,,2,Yupeng Jiao,40,4,36,0
HNUH278V,"Climate Change, Infectious Disease, and Civil Society","Viruses that are lethal to human life have been on earth for centuries. Why are they surging now? And how can we respond to the recent breakneck spread of Coronavirus? This class begins its journey with Homo sapiens, our ancestor that dispersed out of Africa and carried infectious diseases across the planet. Human expansion into new ecosystems also provided opportunities for us to acquire new pathogens. While all of human history is marked by diseases caused by human migration, the Industrial Revolution greatly accelerated human mobility while planting the seeds of the human impact on climate change. Today, the increasingly rapid movement of people and goods, combined with a warming planet and the large-scale disruption of major ecosystems has witnessed an unprecedented spread of infectious diseases. Students will explore how these trends impact our lives and collectively challenge themselves to do what must be done to save our planet and ourselves.",202308,University Honors,,1,Jonathan Dinman,20,10,10,0
HNUH288B,"Race, Reproduction and Rights","Can humanity thrive without ensuring reproductive freedom? The 2022 US Supreme Court decision that the right to an abortion is unconstitutional has generated impassioned debate about women's rights and access to reproductive health care in the US and globally. This debate opens space to think beyond ""pro-choice or pro-life"" polarization and create conditions that promote equity, respect for rights, and a healthy society. These conditions would need to address injustices such as the racism, gender inequalities, marginalization, and colonization that produce disparities in reproductive health care and jeopardize the well-being of individuals, families, communities, and countries. Who controls the bodies of marginalized women and men? What is the meaning of reproductive rights for people who have little power? This course challenges students to bring together multiple disciplines, become critical data consumers, and develop innovative ways to use this knowledge to influence policy.",202308,University Honors,,1,Sangeetha Madhavan,60,1,59,0
HNUH288U,The Body Knows: Creating Healthy Intimacy on College Campuses,"How do we figure out what we physically desire? How do we know where our boundaries are and how do we communicate that to others? What would it look like to create a campus community where young people are confident about their sexuality and their ability to communicate the nuances of their needs to potential partners? This course is designed as a creative workshop to help students put their own embodied knowledge in conversation with theories and practices of healthy intimacy. Core texts explore the history of sexual violence as a tool of colonization, the relationship between feminism and sex-positivity in popular culture, and the consent theories that have become central to college campus responses to sexual violence. With the help of performance-based techniques, students will have the opportunity to research issues specific to UMD, design curricula for their peers, and advocate for an end to sexual violence on campus.",202308,University Honors,,2,Katherine Lieder,40,28,12,0
HNUH288W,Over My Dead Body: Law and the Ethics of Healthcare,"In real time during the pandemic, we had a front-row seat to how much global healthcare can be a function not of the law but of human action. From how to prioritize populations for vaccines to individual decisions about masks, we were plunged into an almost daily discussion of the values and moral principles that guide nations and people in making choices about healthcare. This class invites students to explore their sense of right and wrong in the public healthcare debate. We will look at traditional issues such as legal paternalism, informed consent, and governmental distrust. And we will take up pressing current issues like abortion's impact on identity/privacy, disparities in marginalized communities, and biometric technologies. Students will acquire the tools to think critically think about these important issues of fairness and what our current practices reveal about society's values.",202308,University Honors,,1,Kerry Tripp,20,3,17,0

IDEA258U,Special Topics in Innovation; Introduction to UI/UX Design,"What does ""User Experience"" mean? It was a term coined by cognitive psychologist and designer Don Norman in the 1990s on the cusp of the new digital era; however, the field in practice has existed long before that. Unfortunately, due to its over use and misuse, the pure concept of UX has become lost in the weeds and details of all of its components and methods. In this course, we will take a deep look at the true meaning of UX as simply ""a user's experience"" and what that means for you as both a designer and a user. You will learn about core UX principles and methodologies from both an academic and practical standpoint and be challenged to apply what you learn in classroom workshops and assignments. Finally, you will be asked to think both inside and outside the bounds of technology to find innovative solutions to real world design problems.",202308,Academy for Innovation & Entrepreneurship,,1,Katherine-Aria Close; Mira Azarm,30,2,28,1

Not only health care providers are relying on Health Technologies to improve patient care, people are increasingly using health devices and apps in their everyday life. Individuals have started using new technologies to collect data, increase awareness, and reflect on and change their behaviors. They also use various tools for curiosity and fun. This course will provide an overview of this exciting field and examine how social and behavioral theories can be applied to create effective health applications.It is difficult to create health technologies that can successfully be integrated into people's daily life due to many obstacles in individuals' data collection, integration, self-reflection, and sharing practices. Understanding these challenges is an important part of designing Health Technologies. Therefore, this course will cover HCI and design thinking methods that you can leverage in understanding the adoption of Health Technologies.

What are some of the most important opinions issued by the Supreme Court that changed society, for the good, and bad? Who are the Court's most important justices? And most of all, how does the Court work?

This course will trace the development of the constitutional doctrine of the Court, the growth of the Court's institutional power, and the Court s interaction with Congress, the president, and society. Discussed are major constitutional law decisions, their political contexts, and the social and behavioral factors that affect judges, justices, and federal court jurisprudence.

PHPE400,Individual and Group Decision-Making,"Foundational issues that arise within the theories of rational choice that underlie the treatments of decision-making found in economics, politics, and the other social sciences. The course is focused on individual decisions (rational choice theory), strategic decisions (game theory) and group decisions (social choice theory). In addition to presenting the formal models of decision making, we also discuss to what extent these mathematical theories explain social interactions. An important aspect of the course is to introduce students to the ways in which economic analysis has been applied to issues in social and political philosophy. Readings will be drawn from the literature in economics, psychology, statistics and political science, as well as philosophy.",202308,"Philosophy, Politics, and Economics",,3,Eric Pacuit,54,1,53,4
PHPE401,Social Philosophy and Political Economy,"Examines capitalism and socialism as differing modes of economic production through several different theoretical lenses. We begin by examining capitalism and socialism as they developed historically, by looking primarily at the work of Adam Smith and Karl Marx. Then, we turn our attention to one of the most important debates in 20th century economics: to what extent rational economic calculation is possible in a socialist commonwealth. After this we turn our attention to how capitalist and socialist modes of production functioned in practice. We end by turning our attention to the ethics of capitalism and socialism: which mode of economic production is most just?",202308,"Philosophy, Politics, and Economics",,1,Antong Liu,25,0,25,5

A comprehensive overview of the field of behavioral endocrinology, the study of the relationship between hormones and behavior, from a psychobiological perspective. Examine the major mammalian endocrine systems, how hormones influence sex determination, how hormones underlie sex differences in brain structure and function, the role of hormones in parental and social behaviors, mood disorders, homeostasis, cognition, and stress. Both normal and abnormal hormonal pathologies will be discussed. Due to the physiological and experimental perspectives, much of the phenomenology will be based on research in species other than humans.

Neighborhoods are considered throughout the historical forces that have shaped them, reaching back to the original formation of ethnic and racial ghettos and moving forward through urban renewal and modern-day gentrification. The changing forms of the real estate projects that have sustained these neighborhoods over time are evaluated . As changes further continued in neighborhoods and altered perceived demands for housing and services, the factors that changed the viability of real estate projects are closely investigated. The course also considers the government and policy landscapes that have helped shape neighborhood form and the real estate types found there.
