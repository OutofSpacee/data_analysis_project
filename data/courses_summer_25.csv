Understanding and controlling the dynamics of infectious diseases remains challenging since factors that drive dynamics are highly interrelated, ranging from host-pathogen interactions, the impact of the environment, and human factors like communication, individual behavior, and surveillance. In this course, we will introduce systems thinking as a tool to characterize interaction networks that impact population-level disease dynamics. We will discuss their use for population-level disease dynamics. We will discuss their use for building strategies of disease prevention and mitigation for a range of diseases in human and environmental contexts, and learn to develop and run systems-informed epidemiological simulations.",202505,Biology,Grad,1,Stephen Beckett; Gabi Steinbach,5,5,0,0,2025-05-01

Researchers in psychology and other sciences are driven to discover whether a cause (X) changes an outcome (Y). Although such relationships are the building block of science, it is no longer sufficient to study whether X causes Y given the complexity of theory/statistics. Researchers can instead study when or for whom the size/sign of an effect changes (moderation analysis) or how or by what means one variable transmits its effect on another (mediation analysis). By the end of this class, you will be able to translate research questions into equations, analyze them in software, and interpret the model results.",202505,Psychology,Undergrad,1,Jacob Coutts,25,25,0,0,2025-05-01

Understanding and controlling the dynamics of infectious diseases remains challenging since factors that drive dynamics are highly interrelated, ranging from host-pathogen interactions, the impact of the environment, and human factors like communication, individual behavior, and surveillance. In this course, we will introduce systems thinking as a tool to characterize interaction networks that impact population-level disease dynamics. We will discuss their use for population-level disease dynamics. We will discuss their use for building strategies of disease prevention and mitigation for a range of diseases in human and environmental contexts, and learn to develop and run systems-informed epidemiological simulations.",202505,Biological Sciences Program,Undergrad,1,Stephen Beckett; Gabi Steinbach,7,7,0,0,2025-05-01

Students will learn about different forages used in cow diets, best practices for production, and methods for assessing forage quality at harvest and during ensiling. Throughout the course, students will cover essential topics such as selecting the best corn variety for corn silage production, soil management, harvesting techniques, and the use of inoculants to enhance forage quality and feeding management. They will also discuss how cows utilize forage efficiently, how to formulate balanced diets, how to evaluate the nutritional quality of silage and the effects of climate change and forage production and quality. By the end of the course, students will develop a comprehensive understanding of forage production and management strategies, their impact on livestock health and productivity, and the environmental considerations associated with forage-based diets.",202505,Animal Science,Undergrad,1,Fabiana De Freitas Cardoso,15,15,0,0,2025-05-01
